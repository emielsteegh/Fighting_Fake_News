And they\u2019re going to do that. And that was \u2014 believe me, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to get credit for it \u2014 but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO\u2019s track record of fighting terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,\u201d he said, stressing that it was \u201cour biggest military operation ever.\u201d NATO \u201chas and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism\u201d and the organization has \u201cstepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg also said that NATO\u2019s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence \u201cwill also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.\u201d But he insisted the role is \u201csomething which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.\u201d", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Zoya Sheftalovich"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The alliance \u2018has been fighting terrorism for years,\u2019 says Jens Stoltenberg.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The alliance \u2018has been fighting terrorism for years,\u2019 says Jens Stoltenberg.", "title": "NATO chief counterattacks against Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-counterattacks-against-donald-trump-jens-stoltenberg/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656-1200x628.jpg", "height": 628}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "foreign-affairs,politics", "wp-parsely_version": "1.10.1", "article": {"published_time": "2016-09-27T13:22:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-09-30T09:46:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-counterattacks-against-donald-trump-jens-stoltenberg/", "images": ["http://allbritton.122.2o7.net/b/ss/allbrittonpoliticoeurope/1/H.27.5--NS/0", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Influence.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Florian-90x90-small.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656-714x500.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20415958&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656-1200x628.jpg", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Brexit_Files90x90.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-610600346-90x60.jpg", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sunday_Crunch_90x90.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ryan1.png"], "title": "NATO chief counterattacks against Donald Trump \u2013 POLITICO", "url": "http://politi.co/2d15Len", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474982556000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

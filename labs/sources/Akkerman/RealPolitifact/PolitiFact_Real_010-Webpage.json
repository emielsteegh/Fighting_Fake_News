Clinton has so far given \"Stronger Together\" speeches on faith, community service and children and families.\n\nWhile those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast.

And Wednesday's speech will be no different.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Dan Merica"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump.", "pubdate": "2016-09-20T19:08:23Z", "author": "Dan Merica, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump.", "pubdate": "2016-09-20T19:08:23Z", "title": "Clinton economy speech to focus on valuing people with disabilities", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-economy-speech-donald-trump/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160914164646-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160914164646-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-vls-col,col-hillary-clinton", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-economy-speech-donald-trump/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Clinton economy speech to focus on valuing people with disabilities - CNNPolitics", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Dan-Merica-659931107443856"}, "lastmod": "2016-09-20T22:51:42Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160914164646-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg", "description": "Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Clinton economy speech to focus on valuing people with disabilities"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-economy-speech-donald-trump/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160914164646-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161106154708-mobile-only-square-clinton-comey-split-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161111132518-04-week-in-politics-1113-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170502161453-04-hrc-amanpour-0502-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170502144003-hillary-clinton-may-2-2017-06-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161110182954-hillary-clinton-margot-gerster-photo-still-only-00000000-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170526135301-hillary-clinton-wellesley-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170502135948-hillary-clinton-may-2-2017-01-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161109170040-08-clinton-concession-speech-1109-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170531174125-clinton-trump-tweet-02-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160913140215-clinton-trump-split-0913-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160913140215-clinton-trump-split-0913-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170120151939-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-luncheon-inauguration-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170502155234-03-hrc-amanpour-0502-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161109112541-02-hillary-clinton-concession-screengrab-1109-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170331235347-clinton-georgetown-women-men-peace-bts-00004215-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161109095636-36-hour-clinton-campaign-rollercoaster-origwx-00012214-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161126120531-02-hillary-clinton-file-1116-restricted-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170331094515-biden-criticizes-clinton-campaign-nr-00000000-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170324124352-01-devin-nunes-0324-large-169.jpg"], "title": "Clinton economy speech to focus on valuing people with disabilities", "url": "http://cnn.it/2deB1Fu", "summary": "", "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ891SoIsdQ"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}

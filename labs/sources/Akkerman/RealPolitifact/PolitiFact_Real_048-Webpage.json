That\u2019s big news! It\u2019s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.\u201d\n\nCNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied:\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that\u2019s the way it will continue to be.\u201d\n\nContinue reading below the advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFord has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there.\n\nSo once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy. That\u2019s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland\u2013states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin\u2013where Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. All he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. And lies. Lots and lots of lies. Tax those and we could pay off the national debt.\n\nFeatured Image Via Business Trajectory\n\n80510 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Follow On Twitter", "Visit Website"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Donald Trump told Fox News that Ford is moving all of its production to Mexico, but CEO Mark Fields says that is total bullsh*t.", "og": {"site_name": "portal.liberalamerica.org", "description": "Donald Trump told Fox News that Ford is moving all of its production to Mexico, but CEO Mark Fields says that is total bullsh*t.", "title": "Ford Motor CEO Says Trump Is Lying AGAIN!

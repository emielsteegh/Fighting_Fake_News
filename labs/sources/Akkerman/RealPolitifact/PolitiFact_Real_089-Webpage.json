Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.\n\nAnderson\u2019s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a \u201croundabout\u201d way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere.\n\n\u201cI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,\u201d Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country\u2019s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) \u2014 and if you\u2019ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his \u2018thing.\u2019 The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a \u201cprohibited immigrant\u201d:\n\nPastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana \u2014 Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016\n\nWhat prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be \u201cstoned to death.\u201d Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn\u2019t advocate violence, the victims were \u201cdisgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.\u201d\n\nAnderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn\u2019t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), \u201cif it did then yes I would condone it\u201d because \u201cthe Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country\u2019s acceptance of \u201cf*ggots,\u201d has called the Orlando massacre \u201cgood news\u201d because a bunch of \u201cf*ggots\u201d died (he later expanded on that by adding that \u201cperfect Christians\u201d would \u201cbathe\u201d in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world \u201cto cure AIDS.\u201d\n\nYou can watch Anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll play it on repeat and laugh.\n\nYou can see an interview with his camera guy here:\n\nFeatured image via screen capture", "authors": ["John Prager"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "This made my day!", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "John Prager", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "This made my day!", "title": "Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be \u2018Stoned to Death\u2019 (VIDEO)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This made my day!", "creator": "@EvilLiberalPig", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "title": "Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be 'Stoned to Death' (VIDEO)", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/iamyourknight"}, "keywords": "Africa, arrest, botswana, deportation, South Africa, stephen anderson", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/896e3249030ff74276709a1914c25ea3?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be \u2018Stoned to Death\u2019 (VIDEO)", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "summary": "", "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/okWisU--wys?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ev6IE12obr8?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474329600000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

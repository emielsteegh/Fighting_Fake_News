He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him.\n\nObama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Claire Corkery"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "A six-year-old boy has won the respect of President Obama and many others after he offered to take in a Syrian boy who was the victim of an airstrike.", "pubdate": "2016-09-22T12:54:02Z", "author": "Claire Corkery, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "A six-year-old boy has won the respect of President Obama and many others after he offered to take in a Syrian boy who was the victim of an airstrike.", "pubdate": "2016-09-22T12:54:02Z", "title": "US boy asks Obama if he can adopt refugee", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/boys-letter-to-obama-syria-refugee/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922130515-boys-letter-to-obama-alex-omran-daqneesh-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922130515-boys-letter-to-obama-alex-omran-daqneesh-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/boys-letter-to-obama-syria-refugee/index.html"}, "keywords": "alex, obama, barack obama, letter, omran daqneesh, Syria, Aleppo, New York, politics, US boy, six, asks Obama if he can adopt Omran Daqneesh - CNNPolitics", "lastmod": "2016-09-22T18:44:34Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922130515-boys-letter-to-obama-alex-omran-daqneesh-super-tease.jpg", "description": "A six-year-old boy has won the respect of President Obama and many others after he offered to take in a Syrian boy who was the victim of an airstrike.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "US boy asks Obama if he can adopt refugee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/boys-letter-to-obama-syria-refugee/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919220731-donald-trump-jr-01-081916-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922130515-boys-letter-to-obama-alex-omran-daqneesh-super-tease.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922135013-boy-writes-obama-letter-3-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922130515-boys-letter-to-obama-alex-omran-daqneesh-large-169.jpg"], "title": "US boy, six, asks Obama if he can adopt Omran Daqneesh", "url": "http://cnn.it/2cTxgav", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}

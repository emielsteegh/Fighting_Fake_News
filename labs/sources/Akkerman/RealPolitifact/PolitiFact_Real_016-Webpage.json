But in this case it\u2019s not Donald Trump. It\u2019s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.\n\nLike Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia\u2019s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump\u2019s strongest states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWest Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49\u201331 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders\u2019 51 percent in the state\u2019s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.\n\nThat\u2019s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia\u2019s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It\u2019s very nearly the opposite of what\u2019s happening in other states with close races.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it\u2019s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,\u201d says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThis is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.\u201d\n\nIn this race, Trump isn\u2019t a drag on Republicans; he\u2019s an asset.\n\nThe reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with \u201cwar on coal\u201d rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It\u2019s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia\u2019s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.\n\nCole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he\u2019s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.\n\nIn a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,\u201d says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. \u201cIf you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known\u2014the wall, universal health care, the coal industry\u2014but so much of what\u2019s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.\u201d\n\nJustice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He\u2019s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won\u2019t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole\u2019s claim that he supports Obama as \u201ccomplete dog snot.\u201d\n\nAnd while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate \u201cisn\u2019t focused on the national political circus,\u201d the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. \u201cJim is no politician,\u201d says Herring. \u201cHe is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.\n\nMany doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. \u201cDo I think Justice has a lead? Yes,\u201d says Gates. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s double digits? No.\u201d\n\nSome of that is because Justice\u2019s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP\u2019s otherwise effective \u201cwar on coal\u201d messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says Dave \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he\u2019s voting for Trump, says voters don\u2019t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. \u201cShe said she\u2019s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don\u2019t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says one Democratic strategist.\n\nBut Saunders doesn\u2019t have kind words for Justice either: \u201cHe\u2019s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.\u201d\n\nCole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice\u2019s business record over the next several weeks. \u201cJim Justice is a coal operator, but he\u2019s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,\u201d Gates says. \u201cHis legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.\u201d\n\nThat record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice \u201cstands out\u201d among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.\n\nThe problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice\u2019s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That\u2019s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.\n\nThe pattern apparently extends to Justice\u2019s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.\n\nJustice\u2019s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.\n\nBoth Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that\u2019s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, West Virginia\u2019s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.\n\nMines sit idle as a string of industry giants\u2014 Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy\u2014filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it\u2019s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.\n\nThe coal industry\u2019s struggles haven\u2019t just hurt West Virginia\u2019s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.\n\nJustice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he\u2019s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints\u2019 training camp to the Greenbrier.\n\nIn late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\nJustice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier\u2019s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.\n\nWhether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor\u2019s race from \u201cLeans Republican\u201d to \u201cToss-up.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,\u201d Kondik says.\n\nTrump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor\u2019s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That\u2019s why Cole\u2019s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn\u2019t matter, so long as they\u2019re not voting for Justice.\n\nIn his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: \u201cAt the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what\u2019s best for Jim Justice.\u201d\n\nThat line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what\u2019s in Justice and Trump\u2019s best interests is in theirs, too.\n\nMason Adams writes from southwest Virginia.

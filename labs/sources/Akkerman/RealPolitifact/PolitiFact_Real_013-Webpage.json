The city of New York recently ended \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:\n\nIn a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community\u201d and \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Trump responded by proposing that \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. \u201cI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,\u201d Trump told the questioner.\n\nStop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.\n\nWhen the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\n\nFormer US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as \u201cdestructive\u201d in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:\n\n\u201cIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.\u201d\n\nFeatured image via Flickr", "authors": ["Oliver Willis"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "This policy has been proven to be racist, and Trump wants it in every state.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Oliver Willis", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "This policy has been proven to be racist, and Trump wants it in every state.", "title": "Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This policy has been proven to be racist, and Trump wants it in every state.", "title": "Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "criminal justice, Donald Trump, police, race, racism", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a922443535caa967b15e18639ed76c4?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474416000000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: \u201cPeople have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I\u2019m excited if it is. I\u2019ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: \u201cI don\u2019t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff\u2026In fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.\u201d\n\nOf course, on one level, Trump wasn\u2019t wrong\u00ad\u00ad\u2014in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession.\n\nThis recession most severely impacted low-income folks \u2013 people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income \u2013 Trump\u2019s response is just \u201cThat\u2019s called business.\u201d\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldn\u2019t stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?\n\nHoward Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.\n\nDean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:\n\nNotice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? \u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.\n\nAnd considering he hasn\u2019t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.\n\nOf course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.\n\nDean\u2019s assertion is just that \u2014 an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything she\u2019s not.\n\nIf this debate showed one thing, it\u2019s that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.\n\nFeatured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images", "authors": ["Ryan Denson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Here come the 'offended' Trump supporters.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Ryan Denson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Here come the 'offended' Trump supporters.", "title": "Howard Dean ROASTS Trump Over Debate Sniffles: \u2018Coke User\u2019?

Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.\n\nSo while it\u2019s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.\n\nNate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton\u2019s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times\u2019 election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.\n\nAgain, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.\n\nDemocrats shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.\n\nWith 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.\n\nRachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:\n\nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", "authors": ["Ryan Denson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Ryan Denson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!", "title": "Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!", "title": "Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "democrats, Donald Trump, early voting, FiveThirtyEight, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Nate Silver, New York Times, north carolina, Pat McCory, President Obama, Rachel Maddow", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1ccf1e84217f74b13f4522b4f8d267?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474588800000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}

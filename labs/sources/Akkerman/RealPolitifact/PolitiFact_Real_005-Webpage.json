Lester Holt is not a lawyer,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.\u201d\n\nThe former mayor maintained that \u201cevery cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America\u201d but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt \u201cbecause she failed the bar exam.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you\u2019re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. I\u2019m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,\u201d Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night \u2014 if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you\u2019re gonna interrupt and you\u2019re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.\u201d\n\nGiuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being \u201ccompletely unprofessional\u201d and \u201ctotally unethical\u201d and suggesting that \u201che should have had enough energy to check the sources\u201d regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cI saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,\u201d Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern.\n\n\u201cA hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Giuliani took issue with Holt \u201cignorantly\u201d attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Giuliani took issue with Holt \u201cignorantly\u201d attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.", "title": "Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley", "url": "http://politi.co/2d0wmYU", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3780/1155968404_5143636422001_5143635290001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NolanDMcCaskill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/giuliani-lester-holt-fact-checking-228773", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3780/1155968404_5143636422001_5143635290001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley", "url": "http://politi.co/2dd2Ajf", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474971551000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.\n\nSo what\u2019s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump\u2019s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency, which was Clinton\u2019s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions\u2014from his announcement speech on\u2014the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump\u2019s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters\u2014and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought\u2014do not hear him the way those of us who\u2019ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he\u2019s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn\u2019t matter, because he\u2019s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf he\u2019s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.\n\nMeasured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is \u201cunfit\u201d for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.\n\nAnd what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It\u2019s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.\n\nOn the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then \u2026 the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the \u201cbirther\u201d issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his \u201cdefenses\u201d\u2014that he \u201dtook advantage of the laws of the nation\u201d in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes\u2014were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It\u2019s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that \u201cthe people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\u201d\n\nMoreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out \u201cracist:\u2019 charging he\u2019d \u201cstiffed\u201d many of those who\u2019d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)\n\nFinally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the \u201clook\u201d of a president\u2014a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of \u201cstamina,\u201d a smiling Clinton was ready.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cas soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d\n\nThat worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it\u2019s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I\u2019m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Jeff Greenfield"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The GOP candidate has defied the ordinary rules all along and still come out on top.

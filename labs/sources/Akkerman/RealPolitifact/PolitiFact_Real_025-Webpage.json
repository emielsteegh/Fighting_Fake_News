However, there\u2019s one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America.\n\nWell, since Trump won\u2019t readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it \u201cA Buyer\u2019s Guide For Donald Trump.\u201d While Donald Trump says that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to have apparel made in this country,\u201d or \u201cthey don\u2019t even make the stuff here. It\u2019s so hard to get.\u201d Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:\n\nHillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, here\u2019s all the places Trump can make ties:\n\nInstead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go to Hillary\u2019s website for a full list. In other words, Trump\u2019s rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies.\n\nThanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

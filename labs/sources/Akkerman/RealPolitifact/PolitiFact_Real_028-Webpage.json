The document proved Obama was born in Hawaii.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate,\" Trump said. As moderator Lester Holt tried to ask Trump what he would say to Americans worried about the racial dimensions of birtherism, Trump cut off the question and said: \"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.\"\n\nThe Republican nominee also insisted that it was Clinton associates who first tried to peddle false rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. He further pointed to Clinton's tough Democratic primary clash with Obama in the 2008 presidential race in claiming that she had treated the president with disrespect.\n\nClinton used the exchange to raise reports of how, back in the 1970s, some of Trump's properties were sued for racial discrimination because they would not rent apartments to African Americans.\n\n\"He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one,\" Clinton said. \"Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him.\"\n\nTrump retorted by saying his company had settled \"the suit with zero -- no admission of guilt.\" He also insisted that he's formed strong relationships with African Americans \"over the last little while.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nahal Toosi", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Clinton said his &quot;racist lie&quot; is one that &quot;can't be dismissed that easily.&quot;", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Clinton said his &quot;racist lie&quot; is one that &quot;can't be dismissed that easily.&quot;", "title": "Clinton on Trump's birther claim: A 'racist lie'", "url": "http://politi.co/2dmOEGd", "image": "http://static.politico.com/e1/aa/f4bdf2c546fc8b9eaf34912913b0/clinton-7-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clinton-trump-birther-racist-228735", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/e1/aa/f4bdf2c546fc8b9eaf34912913b0/clinton-7-gty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/d19929a/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe1%2Faa%2Ff4bdf2c546fc8b9eaf34912913b0%2Fclinton-7-gty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Clinton on Trump's birther claim: A 'racist lie'", "url": "http://politi.co/2d25FGy", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474928824000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

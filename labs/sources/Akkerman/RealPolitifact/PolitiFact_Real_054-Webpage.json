{"title":"'Locked the black bitch out': White students under investigation after racist Snapchat reveals campus harassment", "text":"The University of North Dakota is investigating a racist social media post that apparently shows white students locking a black student out of her own dorm room.\r\n\r\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, student Etonde Maloke shared a photo of three white female students laughing in a dorm room. The photo includes the caption, \u201CLocked the black bitch out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below,\u201D Maloke wrote. \u201CThey captioned it \u2018locked the black bitch out\u2019. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didn\u2019t even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not),\u201D she bemoaned. \u201CWhen said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe university later released a statement on Twitter addressing the incident.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is portrayed is not part of the community values that we expound,\u201D the statement said. \u201CWe take seriously issues related to respect for all.\u201D"}

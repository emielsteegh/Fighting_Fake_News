It's not nice.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump's veiled reference followed a tough attack from Clinton, who referenced his past comments about women being \u201cpigs\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d and said Trump \u201cloves hanging around beauty contests\u201d during Monday night\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cHe tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nTrump also said that Clinton has been hitting him \u201cwith tremendous commercials. Some of it's in entertainment.\u201d Trump added that Rosie O\u2019Donnell, the focus of some of his comments has \u201cbeen very tough to me.\u201d\n\nClinton has spent \u201chundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads ... many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,\u201d Trump told reporters after the debate. \u201cBecause I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn\u2019t want to say what I was going to say.\u201d\n\nAnd what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we\u2019ll see,\u201d he responded.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Maggie Severns", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;I said to myself, I can't do it,\u201d Trump said.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;I said to myself, I can't do it,\u201d Trump said.", "title": "Trump: 'I was going to say something extremely rough' to Clinton", "url": "http://politi.co/2dmShMk", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1812/1155968404_5142743923001_5142730096001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/what-was-trump-going-to-say-to-clinton-first-debate-228744", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1812/1155968404_5142743923001_5142730096001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump: 'I was going to say something extremely rough' to Clinton", "url": "http://politi.co/2cYOq5I", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474931249000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

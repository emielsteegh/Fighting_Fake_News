Kaine doesn't feel bad for Pence\n\nTim Kaine doesn't feel much pressure when it comes to the day-to-day routine of defending and explaining the platform and background of running mate Hillary Clinton to voters, the Virginia senator said in an interview airing Wednesday on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"\n\n\"Obviously because you're the nominee for vice president you have to defend Hillary because that\u2019s your job,\" DeGeneres remarked to Kaine during the friendly interview, to which Kaine affirmed, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDeGeneres then asked, \"Do you feel bad for Mike Pence that he has to defend \u2026 he\u2019s got to be constantly like, 'oh, no what do I say now.' 'What did [Donald Trump] say now?'\" as Kaine and members of the audience laughed.\n\n\"It is part of the role,\" Kaine said, declining to specifically mention Pence or his defense of Donald Trump. \"I don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work I have to do to tell people Hillary\u2019s story,\" Kaine added, drawing on their biographical parallels as Midwesterners who \"both grew up in Republican families ... in small business families\" and \"in religious households.\"\n\nKaine added, \"I kind of know the vibe. I know that for example, for her it\u2019s not easy for her to talk about herself, that\u2019s just not the way we were raised, but it\u2019s easier for me to talk about her so that\u2019s something I like to do is to tell stories about things she\u2019s done that really show who she is as a person and the kind of president she\u2019ll be.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;Obviously because you're the nominee for vice president you have to defend Hillary because that\u2019s your job,&quot; DeGeneres says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;Obviously because you're the nominee for vice president you have to defend Hillary because that\u2019s your job,&quot; DeGeneres says.", "title": "Kaine doesn't feel bad for Pence", "url": "http://politi.co/2cHk9YL", "image": "http://static.politico.com/44/43/c1e7650b4ec89c28c717762144bb/07-tim-kaine-8-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/tim-kaine-ellen-degeneres-show-228459", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/44/43/c1e7650b4ec89c28c717762144bb/07-tim-kaine-8-ap-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/3f8b184/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F44%2F43%2Fc1e7650b4ec89c28c717762144bb%2F07-tim-kaine-8-ap-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Kaine doesn't feel bad for Pence", "url": "http://politi.co/2cRoo3f", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474452760000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

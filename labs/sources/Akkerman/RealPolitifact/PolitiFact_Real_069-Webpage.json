{"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "text": "On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City.\n\nThis would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn\u2019t been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media \u2013 and they didn\u2019t hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahami\u2019s capture, he\u2019d dissed the NYPD for allowing \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBC\u2019s Christopher Hayes, who tweeted:\n\nHayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said:\n\n\u201cYou know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don\u2019t want to be accused of profiling, and they don\u2019t want to be accused of all sorts of things.\u201d\n\nYup \u2013 Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:\n\nThis tweet was particularly funny, and I\u2019m sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with:\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a \u201claw and order\u201d candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.\n\nFeatured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Trump thinks Americans are too dumb to remember what he said 9 minutes ago.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Vera", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Trump thinks Americans are too dumb to remember what he said 9 minutes ago.", "title": "Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn\u2019t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump thinks Americans are too dumb to remember what he said 9 minutes ago.", "title": "Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn\u2019t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "2016 Election, Conservative, Donald Trump, GOP, law enforcement, nypd, police officers, Republican, terrorism", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "images": ["http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.30-PM.png", "http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.26-PM.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.43-PM.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5bed92dd30b770a447beb34165598d8?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.36-PM.png", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.20-PM.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.59-PM.png", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.05-PM.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn\u2019t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474243200000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

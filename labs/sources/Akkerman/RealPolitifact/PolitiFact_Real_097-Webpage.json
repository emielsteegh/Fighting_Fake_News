Chuck Schumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover\n\nChuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he\u2019s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.\n\nThe New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm on Tuesday. He\u2019s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.\n\nRepublicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.\n\n\u201cThe Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to allocate our resources so they\u2019re meaningful to us and our candidates.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.\n\nSchumer\u2019s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party\u2019s candidates and a reflection of Democrats\u2019 future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.\n\nSchumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates\u2019 committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He\u2019s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that\u2019s projected to bring in \u201cupwards of another million,\u201d according to a person close to the New York senator.\n\n\u201cSchumer has been relentless,\u201d said a DSCC official.\n\nSchumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.\n\n\u201cLeader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,\u201d McCue said in a statement.\n\nSchumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.\n\nSchumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer\u2019s colleagues won\u2019t rule out the possibility that he\u2019ll donate more to his party\u2019s Senate takeover effort.\n\n\u201cIf he thinks it will make a difference, he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019s very calculating,\u201d said a Democratic senator. \u201cChuck will be there if you need him.\u201d\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to watch everything closely. It\u2019s my sense he\u2019s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,\u201d Stabenow said.\n\nThere\u2019s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some tough decisions, which haven\u2019t been made yet,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he\u2019ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,\u201d Thune said in an interview.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans, however, simply don\u2019t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But \u201cit may not make a difference,\u201d the Texan added.\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Burgess Everett", "Seung Min Kim", "John Bresnahan", "Brent Griffiths", "Michael Stratford"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The New York Democrat is transferring $1 million to Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The New York Democrat is transferring $1 million to Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.", "title": "Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6NFKA", "image": "http://static.politico.com/bc/62/02cbcd444b10b9592c44f641b655/160919-chuck-schumer-gettyimages-539051960-1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/chuck-schumer-senate-democrats-228384", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/749a038/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbc%2F62%2F02cbcd444b10b9592c44f641b655%2F160919-chuck-schumer-gettyimages-539051960-1.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/bc/62/02cbcd444b10b9592c44f641b655/160919-chuck-schumer-gettyimages-539051960-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover", "url": "http://politi.co/2cYJWvx", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474348829000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

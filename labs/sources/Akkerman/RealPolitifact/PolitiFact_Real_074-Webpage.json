And he took a shot at Obama\u2019s leadership, or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader. How can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities?\u201d\n\nTrump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president\u2019s responsibility \u201cto address this crisis and save African-American lives,\u201d has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.\n\nTrump's overtures to black voters \u2014 often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences \u2014 have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cdrugs are a very, very big factor\u201d in what's happening in Charlotte.\n\nStill, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee said there \u201cjust seems that there\u2019s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte \u2014 a great place \u2014 and you just see it.\u201d\n\nProtests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.\n\nBy Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott\u2019s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family\u2019s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video \"can somehow help us reach that truth.\"\n\nJustin Bamberg, another of the family\u2019s attorney\u2019s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that \u201cpictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.\u201d He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott\u2019s wife was present when he was shot.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,\u201d Bamberg said when asked why the family\u2019s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. \u201cYes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the \u201cdifficulties\u201d her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. \u201cI know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.\u201d\n\nWednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.\n\n\u201cI see it even going out. There\u2019s such a lack of \u2014 there\u2019s a lack of spirit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of something. Something\u2019s going on that\u2019s bad, and what\u2019s going on between police and others is getting worse.\u201d\n\nThe real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s wow, here we go again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. When you look at what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very divided, our country, and it\u2019s getting worse. I\u2019m not overly surprised to see it, but it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nTrump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won\u2019t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was \u2014 that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there\u2019s something deeper than that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America\u2019s current leader.\n\n\u201cWell, it really has to be \u2014 you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there\u2019s no unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It\u2019s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it\u2019s so sad to see. But there\u2019s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.\u201d\n\nBut what Trump didn\u2019t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama\u2019s lack of leadership.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we\u2019ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that\u2019s a tragic failure of leadership,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cBut my guess is he was afraid it\u2019d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,\u201d he added. \u201cHe could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday\u2019s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was \u201ca more difficult situation\u201d than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the \u201cambiguous, troubling category.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut even there, you gotta say to people, \u2018Wait, let the investigation play out.\u2019 The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D", "Heather Caygle", "Rachael Bade", "Eli Stokols", "Louis Nelson", "Josh Gerstein"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;It\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d Trump says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;It\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d Trump says.", "title": "Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6AMQy", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-on-charlotte-protests-228512", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest", "url": "http://politi.co/2cJlAWU", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474532948000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

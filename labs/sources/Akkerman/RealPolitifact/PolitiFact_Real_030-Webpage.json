Peter King: We shouldn't be 'pandering' to political correctness\n\nNew York Rep. Peter King rejected former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with American Muslims. Instead, the 11-term congressman called for more surveillance within the community.\n\n\u201cI disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the Muslim community, they have no reason not to trust the police,\u201d King said on MSNBC shortly after Clinton answered questions from the press on the weekend\u2019s bombing in Manhattan.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKing is not new to this topic. His insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within Islam drew comparisons to Sen. Joseph McCarthy\u2019s infamous communist witch hunt. (King has said he considers such attacks on him a \"badge of honor.\") As she has before, Clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart ISIL\u2019s efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith.\n\nBut the only way to gather such intelligence, King said, is to step up surveillance.\n\n\u201cSo listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring Muslim Americans outside,\u201d King said. \u201cTo get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers. That\u2019s what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the Westies and the Irish, whether it\u2019s the Italians and the mafia, that's how you do it. We shouldn't be pandering to political correctness.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "King is not new to this topic.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "King is not new to this topic.", "title": "Rep.

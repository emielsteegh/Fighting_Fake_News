Jean Shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes.\n\nJean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and she wasn\u2019t just any member. Shepard was known as the \u201cGrand Lady\u201d. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years \u2013 which is how she earned the name.\n\nThe Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for.\n\nOf course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn\u2019t the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all.\n\n\u201cSixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,\u2026I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much. Isn\u2019t it terrible being so truthful?\u201d\n\nThe Grand Lady passed away from complications due to Parkinson\u2019s disease on September 25, 2016. Jean\u2019s publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken.\n\n\u201cJean was born Ollie Imogene Shepard in Oklahoma and raised one of ten children in Visalia, California. At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she\u2019d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band\u2019s \u2018girl singer.'\u201d\n\nThere is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady. She was survived by her husband and her 3 sons.\n\nPlease continue to pray for this family during their time of loss.\n\nRIP JEAN SHEPARD", "authors": ["Nancy Wells"], "keywords": [], "meta_data":

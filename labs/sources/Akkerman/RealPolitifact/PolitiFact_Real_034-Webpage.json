But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns \u201cagainst my lawyer\u2019s wishes\u201d if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cAs soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,\u201d Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, \u201cI will release my tax returns.\u201d\n\nThe White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the \u201cmost extreme version\u201d of \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. \u201cI call it trumped-up trickle-down because that\u2019s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBefore Trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, Clinton took another jab.\n\n\u201cDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.\u201d\n\nTrump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.\n\nTrump fired back, blaming \u201cpoliticians like Secretary Clinton\u201d for plunging the nation into debt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a debtor nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on so many of your ideas.\u201d\n\nClinton suggested that Trump\u2019s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. But Trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste.\n\n\u201cIt would be squandered too, believe me,\u201d he said.\n\nABC News' Nicole Phillip, Maggie McNish and Sunny Choo contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Abc News", "More Morgan"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Trump, Clinton Spar Over Taxes in 1st Presidential Debate", "description": "The candidates wasted no time in sparring over taxes and their tax plans.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "The candidates wasted no time in sparring over taxes and their tax plans.", "title": "Trump, Clinton Spar Over Taxes in 1st Presidential Debate", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The candidates wasted no time in sparring over taxes and their tax plans.", "title": "Trump, Clinton Spar Over Taxes in 1st Presidential Debate", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@MorganWinsor", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42379366", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42379366", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-28", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42379366", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42379366", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-28", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-28 14:54:03", "keywords": "abcnews, debate, debates, hillary clinton, donald trump, taxes, economic, plan, policy, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "article": {"author": "/author/morgan_winsor"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "abcnews, debate, debates, hillary clinton, donald trump, taxes, economic, plan, policy"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_12x5_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg"], "title": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Spar Over Taxes in First Presidential Debate", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2dnuLiI", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}

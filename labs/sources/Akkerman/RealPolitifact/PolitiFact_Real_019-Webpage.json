Perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. He is clearly in shock. It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives.\n\nWell, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. The Donald\u2019s mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down the media\u2019s coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing, they\u2019d be \u201cwarming up the gas chamber.\u201d Well, now, he\u2019s gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles:\n\nThis image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016\n\nAnd as if this weren\u2019t bad enough, comparing human beings to a bowl of candy, this is actually a white supremacist meme.\n\nThe Skittles are a reference to white supremacist meme. Changed from M&Ms to Skittles because of George Zimmerman. https://t.co/86FsWdft5O \u2014 Laura Seay (@texasinafrica) September 20, 2016\n\nGeorge Zimmerman is, of course, the wannabe cop who got away with murdering Trayvon Martin, a black teen who was walking home from the store in Florida with only a can of iced tea and a package of skittles. So, in other words, once again, Trump Jr. is openly courting white supremacists on his father\u2019s behalf.\n\nSkittles spokeswoman Denise Young said that her company, Wrigley, which is the parent company that produces skittles, didn\u2019t believe Trump Jr\u2019s image was \u201cappropriate.\u201d She went on to say:\n\n\u201cSkittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don\u2019t feel it\u2019s an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. This meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the Trumps are. Do everything you can to keep them out of the White House, folks. VOTE BLUE.\n\nFeatured image via video screen capture", "authors": ["Shannon Barber"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "And it's a meme that originally appeared on white power websites, too.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Shannon Barber", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "And it's a meme that originally appeared on white power websites, too.", "title": "Trump Jr. Once Again Shows His Lack Of Humanity With Disgusting Tweet About Syrian Refugees", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/trump-jr-once-again-shows-his-lack-of-humanity-with-disgusting-tweet-about-syrian-refugees/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpJr-800x430.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And it's a meme that originally appeared on white power websites, too.", "creator": "@proudgqdyke", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/trump-jr-once-again-shows-his-lack-of-humanity-with-disgusting-tweet-about-syrian-refugees/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpJr-800x430.jpg", "title": "Trump Jr. Once Again Shows His Lack Of Humanity With Disgusting Tweet About Syrian Refugees", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/", "author": "http://facebook.com/shannonforequality"}, "keywords": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/trump-jr-once-again-shows-his-lack-of-humanity-with-disgusting-tweet-about-syrian-refugees/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpJr-800x430.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/33eb8e63d6f325bdcf229ce66edc227a?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5-year-old-wounded-Syrian-kid-Omran-Daqneesh-sits-alone.jpg"], "title": "Trump Jr. Once Again Shows His Lack Of Humanity With Disgusting Tweet About Syrian Refugees", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/20/trump-jr-once-again-shows-his-lack-of-humanity-with-disgusting-tweet-about-syrian-refugees/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474329600000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday.\n\nElection Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president.\n\nVoting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case.\n\nTypically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.\n\nHere\u2019s when early voting begins in each state.\n\n(Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.)\n\nAlabama \u2014 There\u2019s no universal early voting in Alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nAlaska \u2014 Oct. 24.\n\nArizona \u2014 Oct. 12.

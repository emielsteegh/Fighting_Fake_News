The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming \u201cTRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!\u201d That\u2019s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,\u201d a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn\u2019t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama\u2014\u201cWe call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?\u201d\u2014and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they\u2019re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.\n\nHis opponent does not. Clinton\u2019s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world\u2019s most famous and polarizing woman, but she\u2019s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.\n\nTonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven\u2019t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you\u2019re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game\u2014rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency\u2014and when 2016 is over, it\u2019s not clear whether those rules will still apply.\n\nWhatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who\u2019s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d or \u201cStronger Together.\u201d The small venues are selected to target niche groups\u2014millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando\u2014and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very substantial, very specific,\u201d Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a \u201cHil Yes!\u201d pin to Clinton\u2019s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. \u201cThe purpose wasn\u2019t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We\u2019re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.\u201d\n\nClinton had better hope not. There\u2019s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can\u2019t match. It\u2019s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you\u2019re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It\u2019s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (\u201cIt\u2019s 100 degrees in here. And that\u2019s considered cool for an auditorium.\u201d) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell\u2014the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world\u2014then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.\n\nClinton doesn\u2019t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump\u2019s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn\u2019t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.\n\nNobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton\u2019s campaign, like his accusations that it\u2019s \u201cpolicy-free,\u201d when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there\u2019s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches\u2014he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long\u2014with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.\n\n\u201cBom. Bom. Bom. See ya!\u201d Trump smirked. \u201cSee ya! I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nMany Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump\u2019s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he\u2019s shredding every day.\n\n***\n\nBefore attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I\u2019m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the \u201cbad, dishonest, very bad people\u201d in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word \u201csir\u201d to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as \u201ca big fat bubble,\u201d and predicted a collapse that would be \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: \u201cI didn\u2019t put him there! I\u2019m not paying him!\u201d He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself \u201cmore militaristic than anyone in this room,\u201d complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year\u2014actually the president\u2019s salary\u2014and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.\n\n\u201cWhoever the hell brought this mic system\u2014don\u2019t pay the son of a bitch!\u201d he seethed. \u201cDon\u2019t pay em. Don\u2019t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn\u2019t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they\u2019ll pay, they don\u2019t care. So we\u2019re not going to pay. I guarantee, I\u2019m not paying for this mic.\u201d\n\nSo I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola\u2019s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: \u201cTyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!\u201d The crowd started chanting \u201cLOCK HER UP!\u201d before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and\u2026well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said one Trump supporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty\u2026 Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nTrump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clich\u00e9s and Republican talking points about \u201cencrusted insiders\u201d and \u201cturning the page.\u201d He said the kind of things regular politicians say: \u201cThe history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.\u201d And: \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ll have a government of, by, and for the people.\u201d He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd\u2014during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: \u201cWhat about white people?\u201d\u2014but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall\u2014but really, who still thinks about them?\n\nAfterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn\u2019t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing \u201call the problems in the world,\u201d including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that \u201cpersonally, I think she\u2019s an unstable person,\u201d and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone \u201cright smack in the middle of the heart\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted, OK?\u201d He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2014and then he had cozied up again: \u201cHe\u2019s been nice to me, and if he\u2019s nice to me, that\u2019s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that \u201cthe country is collapsing.\u201d\n\nThose all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We\u2019re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military \u201cincredibly weak,\u201d defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community\u2014which endured slavery and Jim Crow\u2014was \u201cin the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!\u201d Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline \u201cRestraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.\u201d Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton\u2019s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn\u2019t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn\u2019t make it through one.\n\nThat sort of behavior just hasn\u2019t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it\u2019s that defiant you-can\u2019t-tell-me-what-I\u2019m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people\u2019s feelings, always watching our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, so it\u2019s cool to see him speak his mind,\u201d said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing\u2014he doesn\u2019t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn\u2019t stumble around like she did on the video\u2014Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: \u201cHe\u2019ll call a spade a spade, and if you don\u2019t like it you can shove it.\u201d Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. \u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we\u2019re offensive. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off\u2014at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn\u2019t want hate in their state: \u201cLazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!\u201d He explained to me that America was under siege, with \u201cthousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,\u201d and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nThe Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition\u2014and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.\n\nOne of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: \u201cWe want our state rights back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,\u201d says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don\u2019t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. \u201cTrump is saying what we\u2019re all thinking: \u2018Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don\u2019t end where your feelings begin!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as \u201cthe oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\u201d And he\u2019s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it\u2019s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: \u201cI\u2019ll say it openly, and some people don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t really care: What do you have to lose?\u201d His long riffs about how he\u2019ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can\u2019t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don\u2019t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent\u2014the real rate is about one third of that\u2014he\u2019s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya\u2014and many I spoke to believe he\u2019s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.\n\nOne notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. \u201cA lot of us who like him don\u2019t like the stuff he says about race,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cObviously, some do.\u201d\n\nThis really isn\u2019t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal\u2014a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams\u2014she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.\n\nI remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.\n\nIn 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She\u2019s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn\u2019t been about standard anything.\n\n***\n\nNearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton\u2019s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an \u201cInclusive Economy,\u201d to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters\u2014a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse\u2014about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton\u2019s concern about a worthy issue.\n\nIt did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a nice speech,\u201d Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. \u201cNot very exciting, but I believe she\u2019ll do what she says.\u201d\n\nThe speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.\n\nThe rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: \u201cAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They\u2019re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.\u201d Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. \u201cIn the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,\u201d Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.\n\nClinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children\u2019s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department\u2019s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she\u2019s known\u2014including the \u201cunbelievably good-looking\u201d actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that \u201cfamily values\u201d should mean that every family has value\u2014and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the \u201csub-minimum wage\u201d that is currently paid to some disabled workers.\n\nThe audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a \u201creally slow, vicious death\u201d to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn\u2019t feel bad if they\u2019re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton\u2019s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton\u2019s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn\u2019t even mention Trump\u2019s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down\u2019s Syndrome and lead a productive life. \u201cWhat Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,\u201d Kilsheimer said. \u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she\u2019s got heart.\u201d\n\nGeannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton\u2019s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they\u2019re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren\u2019t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it\u2019s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump\u2019s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. \u201cMy daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We\u2019ve got plenty to lose,\u201d said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.\u201d\n\nMany Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re all Mexicans, and we\u2019re all bad,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they\u2019ll come out to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. \u201cShe\u2019s OK, I guess,\u201d said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. \u201cMy main worry is Trump\u2019s fingers on the nuclear code. But I\u2019d say she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they\u2019re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she\u2019s a typical lying politician, so they\u2019re voting for Trump\u2014and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they\u2019re staying home.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s great on the issues, but it\u2019s hard to get people to focus on that.\u201d\n\nClinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband\u2019s administration and recovery during Obama\u2019s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. \u201cWhen Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,\u201d said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. \u201cMan, Hillary should talk about that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn\u2019t focused on his policies, because they\u2019re so insubstantial and flexible, because he\u2019s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It\u2019s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump\u2019s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.\n\nSo Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They\u2019ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.\n\n***\n\nTonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump\u2019s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump\u2019s political brand is all about breaking the rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president\u2019s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can\u2019t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight\u2019s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won\u2019t be normal, but it won\u2019t be the first time, either.\n\nAnd yes, even though she\u2019s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo\u2014not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She\u2019s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn\u2019t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn\u2019t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they\u2019ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.\n\nBut the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren\u2019t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they\u2019re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values\u2014showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren\u2019t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences\u2014that have constrained politicians in a good way. It\u2019s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they\u2019re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Michael Grunwald", "Daniel Strauss", "Kyle Cheney", "Daniel Lippman", "Michael Kruse", "M Scott Mahaskey", "Brent Griffiths", "Taylor Gee"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Want to understand what's really at stake tonight?

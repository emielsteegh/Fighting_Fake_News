Ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. They are also charged with attempting to defraud the United States and conspiring to engage in international money laundering.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe charges arise from financial transactions using U.S. dollars between Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, which is under both U.S. and UN sanctions. Those transactions, according to the Justice Department, were conducted both by Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development as well as by \u201cnumerous front companies\u201d that it controlled.\n\nThe Justice Department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 Chinese bank accounts of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and its front corporations. Those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the Justice Department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the United States. Because the money was routed through the U.S., it falls under American jurisdiction, the department said.\n\nPressure has mounted on President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to crack down on China, North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolated nation\u2019s latest nuclear test earlier this month. Republicans and even Obama\u2019s own former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure China to enforce international sanctions against North Korea.\n\nRep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) has specifically called on Obama to put to use the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, a law signed by the president earlier this year that affords his administration authority to sanction any individual who \"imports, exports, or re-exports luxury goods to or into North Korea\" or \"engages in money laundering, counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the government of North Korea or its senior officials.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blamed Clinton for North Korea\u2019s most recent nuclear launch. Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, labeled it \u201cone more example of Hillary Clinton's catastrophic failures as secretary of state,\" and added that \"Clinton promised to work to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear program as secretary of state, yet the program has only grown in strength and sophistication.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Chinese trading company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co.

And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it\u2019s fast,\u201d the First Lady said.\n\nHere\u2019s the video via Twitter.\n\nFLOTUS: \u201cMy great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House. That progress is huge.\u201d https://t.co/A4RwUHYR5z pic.twitter.com/vvhgrtxoYu \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 23, 2016\n\nBut, of course, conservatives lost their shit and displayed their hatred in the comments.\n\n@ABC And the sooner that Mooch and Obummer get out of the White house and Trump gets in, the better! #TrumpPence16 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain \u2014 Chantie Huffines (@LadyChantie) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC But, you keep the narrative going that all white people, except Clintons, are racist. \u2014 Deporable & watsit2u (@thumbug) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC The country is more racist than ever since The Obamas entered the White House. They have a bitter resentment for White People \u2014 Mike Van Patten (@MikeVanPatten4) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC So why are the democrats trying to send race relations back to the sixties? \u2014 Deplorable Voter (@Antone18) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC Keep driving racial segregation down our throats, ABC. These types of post should sure give you more \u201cpeaceful\u201d protest to cover. \u2014 Ashton Allen (@Asherzz09) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC MOVE OUT BIMBO \u2014 Donna Coffey (@Dcoffey56Donna) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC Lord Jesus said to do good as bondmen. \u2014 John Stefanyszyn (@JohnStefanyszyn) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC And we can thank the Republican Party for that. It certainly wasn\u2019t the Democrats. \u2014 Bev Cross (@BevCross1) September 23, 2016\n\n@ABC then they managed to set us back decades by generating a racial divide n bringing anarchy among the people\u2026 awesome job NOT #GOTRUMP \u2014 Jane callaway (@janeewc) September 23, 2016\n\nAnd while it is true that the early Republican Party freed the slaves, it was at a time when Republicans were liberals and Democrats were conservatives. The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country.\n\nIf Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that\u2019s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become.\n\nFeatured image via Wikimedia", "authors": ["Stephen D Foster Jr"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Stephen D Foster Jr", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn.", "title": "Conservatives Throw A Hissy Fit Because Michelle Obama Talked About Slavery At Black History Museum", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/conservatives-throw-a-hissy-fit-because-michelle-obama-talked-about-slavery-at-black-history-museum/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/michelle.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn.", "title": "Conservatives Throw A Hissy Fit Because Michelle Obama Talked About Slavery At Black History Museum", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/conservatives-throw-a-hissy-fit-because-michelle-obama-talked-about-slavery-at-black-history-museum/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/michelle.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "ABC, conservatives, Michelle Obama, racists, slavery, twitter", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/conservatives-throw-a-hissy-fit-because-michelle-obama-talked-about-slavery-at-black-history-museum/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/michelle.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/51f1e004223453ced550219e1431c60d?s=70&d=identicon&r=g"], "title": "Conservatives Throw A Hissy Fit Because Michelle Obama Talked About Slavery At Black History Museum", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/23/conservatives-throw-a-hissy-fit-because-michelle-obama-talked-about-slavery-at-black-history-museum/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474588800000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}

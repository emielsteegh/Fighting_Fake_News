Please direct further questions to USSS.\u201d\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC \u201cspecifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats\u201d on charter aircraft.\n\nA POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trump\u2019s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.\n\nBut the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.\n\nTrump, who once said \u201cI could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,\u201d has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.\n\nThe campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as \u201cmisleading and flat out wrong,\u201d pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.\n\nThe statement explained the campaign\u2019s payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying \u201cthe campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\"It's basically just calling it even,\" Engle said. \"It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.\"\n\nThe same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So it\u2019s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.\n\nThe Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.\n\nThe agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.\n\nOf course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trump\u2019s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Kenneth P", "Jack Shafer", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Vogel Isaac Arnsdorf"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The agency pays to travel with all presidential nominees, but in Trump\u2019s case, that money went to one of his companies.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The agency pays to travel with all presidential nominees, but in Trump\u2019s case, that money went to one of his companies.", "title": "Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service", "url": "http://politi.co/2d86IUo", "image": "http://static.politico.com/bd/ef/782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920/162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-secret-service-campaign-travel-payments-228553", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/bd/ef/782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920/162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/b46e68e/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2Fef%2F782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920%2F162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service", "url": "http://politi.co/2cQ4Ssc", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474571470000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

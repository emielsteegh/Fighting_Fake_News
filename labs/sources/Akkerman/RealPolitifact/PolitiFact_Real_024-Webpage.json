I can take that kind of stuff,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this and, you know, I understand it\u2019s a contact sport.\u201d\n\nTrump also attacked Clinton earlier Tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the Islamic State as head of the State Department.\n\n\u201cCrooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow she has new ideas. It is time for change.\u201d\n\nClinton has no public events planned for Tuesday and has opted to stay at home in Chappaqua, New York, as she prepares for the debate with Trump.\n\nShe had a full campaign schedule on Monday \u2014 between holding a news conference in White Plains, New York, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in Philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in New York City. She is scheduled to return to Florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on Wednesday.\n\nGabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,\u201d he added minutes later. \u201cSleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,\u201d he added minutes later. \u201cSleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!\u201d", "title": "Trump needles Clinton: \u2018Sleep well Hillary \u2014 see you at the debate!\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2d8huL2", "image": "http://static.politico.com/4f/d1/2a153a1445ca8f52a3ea80a5d94c/08-donald-trump-45-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NolanDMcCaskill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-debate-sleep-228407", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/d5525fc/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4f%2Fd1%2F2a153a1445ca8f52a3ea80a5d94c%2F08-donald-trump-45-gty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "http://static.politico.com/4f/d1/2a153a1445ca8f52a3ea80a5d94c/08-donald-trump-45-gty-1160.jpg"], "title": "Trump needles Clinton: \u2018Sleep well Hillary \u2014 see you at the debate!\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2cGp6EH", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474368432000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

Keith Scott is not clearly visible in the video until after he has been shot, when officers surround his body lying on the pavement.\n\nCharlotte police said Keith Scott was holding a gun when officers shot him outside of his apartment on Tuesday. In the video, released by the victim\u2019s family, police officers are heard yelling at Keith Scott to \u201cdrop the gun\u201d while his wife shouts \u201che has no weapon\u201d and \u201che has no gun.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the family have said that Keith Scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victim\u2019s body.\n\nThe video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that he did not plan to release his department\u2019s video of the shooting, although he has allowed the victim\u2019s family and attorneys to view it.\n\nKeith Scott\u2019s shooting by police, along with that of another black man, Terence Crutcher, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has prompted demonstrations nationwide. In Charlotte, those protests grew violent Wednesday night into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency. With National Guard troops looking on and a midnight curfew in effect, protests Thursday night were mostly peaceful.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Cristiano Lima", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The video, recorded by Scott\u2019s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The video, recorded by Scott\u2019s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible.", "title": "Clinton demands Charlotte police video release 'without delay'", "url": "http://politi.co/2cN6kIx", "image": "http://static.politico.com/fd/73/54eec88c47908855e76a38813f95/ap-16267600524055.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/keith-scott-shooting-video-228583", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/cf5aef9/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffd%2F73%2F54eec88c47908855e76a38813f95%2Fap-16267600524055.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/fd/73/54eec88c47908855e76a38813f95/ap-16267600524055.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Clinton demands Charlotte police video release 'without delay'", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6lgRT", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474637900000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

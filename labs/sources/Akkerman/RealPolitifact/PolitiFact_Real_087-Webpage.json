Writers at Quartz have noted that \u201cin at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words \u201clie,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d \u201cfalsely claimed\u201d and \u201cuntrue\u201d appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper\u2019s Trump coverage.\n\nExecutive editor Dean Baquet\u201d said that \u201cI think our investigative work\u2014see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump\u2019s tax breaks\u2014has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies\u2026The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.\u201d\n\nHopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump\u2019s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump\u2019s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.\n\nBut it appears that Trump\u2019s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the \u201cbirther\u201d myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

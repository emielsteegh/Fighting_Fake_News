She\u2019ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea.\n\nClinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2014an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she\u2019s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump\u2019s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt\u2019s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America.\n\nKeeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama\u2019s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator.\n\nBut none of this compares to the degree to which this year\u2019s race is defined by global affairs \u2013 the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy.\n\nClinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn\u2019t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very concerned,\u201d said a Clinton aide. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he\u2019s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nCertainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water\u2019s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIt will have lasting impact,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee\n\n\u201cIt has been changed,\u201d agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. \u201cIt gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.\u201d\n\nThere has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump\u2019s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico\u2019s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America\u2019s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that\u2019s hardly all.\n\nThere was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he\u2019s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.\n\nAnd just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of \u201cplaying into the hands\u201d of ISIL.\n\nOfficials openly wonder what Clinton\u2019s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?\n\nWhile many in Washington\u2019s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.\n\nHer meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they\u2019re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail.\n\nTake Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump\u2019s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it\u2019s important from a policy standpoint,\u201d the aide said.\n\nIf Trump wins, he\u2019ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.\n\n\u201cThey will certainly want to see where we\u2019re coming from,\u201d King said. \u201cHe will have to clarify and make it clear where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nIf Clinton wins, she\u2019ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush.\n\nCardin, who\u2019s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump\u2019s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if Trump were president and we\u2019re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?\u201d Cardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that type of problems that have now been caused.\u201d\n\nThis has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he\u2019s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn\u2019t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.\n\n\u201cIt's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,\u201d said a senior administration official. \u201cSo that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.\n\nHe\u2019ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning.\n\nBut the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn\u2019t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn\u2019t run her meetings this week by the White House either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a serious debate,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama\u2019s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. \u201cWe\u2019re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Edward-isaac Dovere", "Nahal Toosi", "Politico Staff", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Bucking tradition, Clinton and Trump take their campaigns to world leaders.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Bucking tradition, Clinton and Trump take their campaigns to world leaders.", "title": "America's relationships are on the line \u2014 no matter who wins", "url": "http://politi.co/2cx34yw", "image": "http://static.politico.com/29/1a/eabf6f8b423ab495795f08d11ed9/160918-united-nations-gettyimages-606517178-1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/americas-relationships-are-on-the-line-no-matter-who-wins-228342", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/29/1a/eabf6f8b423ab495795f08d11ed9/160918-united-nations-gettyimages-606517178-1.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/73cde89/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F29%2F1a%2Feabf6f8b423ab495795f08d11ed9%2F160918-united-nations-gettyimages-606517178-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "America's relationships are on the line \u2014 no matter who wins", "url": "http://politi.co/2d1xPwp", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474261890000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

A new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to Trump's message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a racist bigot as president,\u201d one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus.\n\nAnother chimes in, \u201cHe makes me terrified.\u201d\n\nAnd a third simply says, \u201cI don\u2019t want him on campus.\u201d\n\nThe Not Who We Are campaign plans to run the ad on Twitter and Facebook ahead of and during Monday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cSince the Donald himself is coming to campus, these Hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as Americans and not who they are as part of the Hofstra community,\u201d Not Who We Are\u2019s campaign manager Josh Hendler said in a statement.\n\nHendler\u2019s group bills itself as a venue for \u201ccommunity members and leaders across the country\u201d to \u201corganize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against\u201d Trump by writing open letters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,\u201d the group\u2019s website says.\n\nThe site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers.\n\nOne recent letter, written by Hofstra student Rob Bielunas, reads in part: \"As a community, Hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas Mr. Trump has used to get where he is today. His hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the Hofstra community, stand up against Donald J Trump\u2019s run for president.\"", "authors": ["More Michael", "Abc News"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Anti-Trump Super PAC Launches Pre-Debate Video", "description": "Anti-Trump Super PAC Launches Pre-Debate Video", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "An anti-Donald Trump super PAC is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this Monday at Hofstra University in New York.\nThe group, the Not Who We Are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point.

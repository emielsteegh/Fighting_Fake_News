And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren\u2019t successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s their own fault. She also said there wasn\u2019t \u201cany racism until Obama got elected\u201d and skirted problems under the table:\n\nIf you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You\u2019ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn\u2019t have. You had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\n\nMiller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a \u201cstupid waste of time\u201d and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to \u201cthe way they\u2019re raised.\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cthe way they\u2019re raised,\u201d supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn\u2019t vote (and couldn\u2019t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.\n\nMiller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump\u2019s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller\u2019s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple \u201cvolunteer\u201d to steer away any influence she once held.\n\nOnce again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it\u2019s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.\n\nFeatured image a screen-grab", "authors": ["Ryan Denson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Another racist Trump staffer.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Ryan Denson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Another racist Trump staffer.", "title": "Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn\u2019t Exist Before Obama \u2013 Promptly Resigns", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Another racist Trump staffer.", "title": "Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn't Exist Before Obama - Promptly Resigns", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "Black Lives Matter, Donald Trump, ohio, racism", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1ccf1e84217f74b13f4522b4f8d267?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn\u2019t Exist Before Obama \u2013 Promptly Resigns", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474502400000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}

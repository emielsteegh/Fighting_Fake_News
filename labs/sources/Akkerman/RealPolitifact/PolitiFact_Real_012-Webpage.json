Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton\u2019s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?\n\nExperience suggests it\u2019s hard to make a positive breakthrough\u2014especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOver the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe\u2014a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.\n\nDespite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don\u2019t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters\u2019 impressions\u2014which matters on Election Day.\n\nFor both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds\u2014which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump\u2019s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.\n\n1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK\n\nFamously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.\n\nOn September 26, at the candidates\u2019 first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.\n\nVideo: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question\u2014here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.\n\nDuring their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn\u2019t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.\n\n2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis\n\nA more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia\u2019s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.\n\nNeither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates \u201cstood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,\u201d wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.\n\nYears later, Ford admitted that \u201cI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren\u2019t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.\u201d In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.\n\n3. 1980: Carter\u2019s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious\n\nIn politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn\u2019t get that lesson.\n\nIn front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right\u2014someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.\n\nWhile Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: \u201cThere you go again,\u201d he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter\u2019s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.\n\n4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan\u2019s one-liner negate a serious weakness\n\nDuring 1984\u2019s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer \u201cthat he had flopped.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: \u201cNew Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?\u201d\n\nFortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: \u201cI will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.\n\n5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question\n\nPerhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.\n\nDukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: \u201cGovernor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\u201d\n\nReporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t Bernard, and I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\u201d\n\nIt was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. \u201cIt was a question about Dukakis\u2019s values and emotions,\u201d his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. \u201cWhen he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.\u201d\n\n6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question\n\nDuring the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.\n\nRight before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. \u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap,\u201d Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.\n\nChecking the time would\u2019ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did\u2014during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates\u2014it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.\n\n7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush\n\nEntering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.\n\nDuring the first debate, Gore\u2019s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush\u2019s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat\u2019s plans for their \u201cfuzzy math,\u201d Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.\n\nAt the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore\u2019s action look odd as the audience laughed.\n\nDonna Brazile, who ran Gore\u2019s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but \u201con mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing \u2026 many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.\u201d\n\n8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry\n\nAfter the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn\u2019t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush\u2019s record.\n\nThough Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren\u2019t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, \u201cFaces of Frustration,\u201d viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush\u2019s angry looks on the right side.\n\n***\n\nAppearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.\n\nAnd on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nJulian E.

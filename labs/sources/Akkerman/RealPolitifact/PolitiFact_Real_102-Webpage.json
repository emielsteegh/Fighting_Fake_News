Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor.\n\nOne of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. \u201cNo-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,\u201d Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: \u201ca bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nGot that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility.

I don\u2019t know, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\n\nThe Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less.\n\nIt is not hard to say \u2013 terrorism, unless you\u2019re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn\u2019t bring himself to utter the word.

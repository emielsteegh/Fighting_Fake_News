This will be the third presidential debate hosted by the university, so you\u2019d think students would be used to this sort of thing.\n\nGuess I was wrong. Look what a CBS News reporter found in the student center:\n\nSign inside Student Center at Hofstra. I guess these are common now on college campuses? #TriggerWarning pic.twitter.com/gfRkKVtToM \u2014 Tony Aiello (@AielloTV) September 26, 2016\n\nYep. A trigger warning. Young adults actually require trigger warnings ahead of presidential debates now. They HAVE to be warned that they might hear some ideas that they\u2013GASP!\u2013 disagree with. Some of the debate topics are super scary OMG!\n\nI wonder how many students will miss school tomorrow. Donald Trump\u2019s presence may induce vomiting and cause mass panic attacks. Quick! Someone grab the smelling salts!\n\nIf you require a trigger warning ahead of a presidential debate, you\u2019re too much of a child to vote.

We never had problems like this \u2026 Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that\u2019s a big change, and I think that\u2019s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.\u201d\n\nThis perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance \u2013 blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.\n\nSupporting her candidate\u2019s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that \u201cif you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You\u2019ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn\u2019t have. You had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\u201d\n\nTo put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that \u201cthe Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time\u201d and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans \u201cwere raised.\u201d\n\nIn one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.\n\nShe is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied \u201cI don\u2019t care, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nUPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.\n\nWatch it here \u2013 her remarks begin at 4:40:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

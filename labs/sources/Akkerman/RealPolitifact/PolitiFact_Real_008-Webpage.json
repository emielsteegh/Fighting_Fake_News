You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there\u2019s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and he\u2019s kind of a politician, but he\u2019s a different kind of politician. He\u2019s a young politician. He\u2019s a Hispanic, He can win. Let\u2019s go for it.\u2019\"\n\nInstead, Beck sought \u201ca truly honorable man\u201d in Cruz \u2014 \u201cand that will always let you down,\u201d he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,\u201d Beck said. \u201cHe is just a politician first. I\u2019ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that\u2019s my fault. He is a politician.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.\n\nAfter Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).\n\n\u201cSo a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross \u2014 it\u2019s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, \u2018Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,\u2019 I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it\u2019s a binary choice?\u201d Beck asked.\n\n\u201cYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,\u201d Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.\n\nBeck, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cThis is information that you had in Cleveland \u2014 and hang on just a second before you respond \u2014 you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,\u201d Beck said. \u201cSo you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: \u2018Oh, my gosh, he\u2019s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there\u2019s a reason to believe him.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his \u201csignificant disagreements\u201d with Trump, Cruz said, it\u2019s a binary choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for new information. I\u2019m asking you for new information,\u201d Beck said. \u201cYou knew all the things that you\u2019re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What\u2019s new?\u201d\n\nCruz pointed to the Trump campaign\u2019s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAfter Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. \u201cNow, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising \u2018I will nominate from these 21,\u2019 I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that\u2019s a clear choice.\u201d\n\nCruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he\u2019s always been \u201cNever Hillary\u201d but not ever \u201cNever Trump.\u201d He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cMy speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBoth of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz\u2019s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. \u201cHe could have come on and said, \u2018Look, guys, here\u2019s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,\u2019 and I know that, because so are mine,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they\u2019re all saying I\u2019ll never fund \u2014 I won\u2019t fund you for the Senate. I won\u2019t fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?\u2019\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cFor the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Beck says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cFor the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Beck says.", "title": "Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement", "url": "http://politi.co/2dmJqL4", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3156/1155968404_5141941317001_5141914283001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NolanDMcCaskill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/glenn-beck-ted-cruz-endorsement-228682", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3156/1155968404_5141941317001_5141914283001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement", "url": "http://politi.co/2dmOPx8", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474902647000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

As part of his continuing African-American \u201coutreach\u201d \u2014 which has traditionally consisted of calling black people uneducated, unemployed and desperate, and their communities poor (\u201cno health care, no education, no anything\u201d as he puts it), and posting white supremacist memes demonizing black people.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s white supporters love this rhetoric because it a.) confirms their biases against African-Americans and b.) seems to them that he is trying to fix problems they suspect exist, proving he\u2019s not the racist pig liberals say he is, the rest of us wonder how anyone can think a guy who literally labeled black rental applicants\u2019 forms with \u201cC\u201d and practiced discrimination could be viewed as a person who would do anything at all to help the black community.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump again continued his outreach \u2014 or, as the rest of us see it, again made his disdain for black people known \u2014 by telling African-Americans (or, more correctly, a room full of white people) that black communities are \u201cin the worst shape that they\u2019ve ever been in before, ever.\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump: African-American communities \"in the worst shape that they\u2019ve ever been in before, ever.\" https://t.co/9LBPglLJSo \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 20, 2016\n\nNaturally, the Internet had some remarks about this, with many wondering how he forgot about Jim Crow, slavery, and other times the black community might have had it just a teensy bit harder in America:\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Slavery? Jim Crow? You call those better? \u2014 Aaron Sarka (@SarkaAaron) September 20, 2016\n\n@theBillGrayson @ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Imagine reaction to black guy talking about whites framed by bleachers full of blacks. \u2014 space_junk (@spacejunkx) September 20, 2016\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump he knows that 1) it's bullshit 2) his audience doesn't know enough about AA's to know that it's BS. \u2014 Bill Grayson (@theBillGrayson) September 20, 2016\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump and he says this again to an all white crowd \u2014 MLWag (@mlwag1) September 20, 2016\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Worse than when racist landlords like you put a \"C\" (colored)next to the name of black rental applicants? Nope \u2014 Jeffrey Bloom (@jeff14mail) September 20, 2016\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Minus 300 years of slavery and the Jim Crow era and his statement is still false \u2014 TPS Report (@ShoNuf77) September 20, 2016\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Did he forget about slavery? Also, not really. They are not as bad as they were a few years ago. \u2014 Salt Pawn Latte (@x_PureSalt_x) September 20, 2016\n\n@ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Did your universe not have that whole Slavery thing? \u2014 Mirror Donald Trump (@MirrorTrump) September 20, 2016\n\nFact check: used to be enslaved, then lacked basic civil rights for 100 years. https://t.co/qLkNcd1GwH \u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) September 20, 2016\n\nI wonder why he's not resonating with African American voters\u2026 https://t.co/K1AK3aCYyn \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) September 20, 2016\n\nI wonder if Trump actually thinks black people are falling for his bullsh*t.\n\nFeatured image via screengrab", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Democrats Winning the Hearts and Minds", "description": "This must be more of that 'outreach' he's doing.", "title": "Twitter Just Wrecked Donald Trump After Horrible Attack On \u2018Black Communities\u2019 (TWEETS)", "url": "http://oppositionreport.com/twitter-just-wrecked-donald-trump-after-horrible-attack-on-black-communities-tweets/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-6.jpg", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-6.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1555147758043521}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-2015-12-18_18-30-53-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1; maximum-scale=1; user-scalable=0;"}, "canonical_link": "http://oppositionreport.com/twitter-just-wrecked-donald-trump-after-horrible-attack-on-black-communities-tweets/", "images": ["http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-3-4.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-08-29_20-03-22.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-2-9.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/896e3249030ff74276709a1914c25ea3?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/themes/ares/data/1488260315_logo copy.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-6.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/alex-wong-trumps-texas-getty-OR.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-08-29_16-05-42.jpg"], "title": "Twitter Just Wrecked Donald Trump After Horrible Attack On \u2018Black Communities\u2019 (TWEETS) \u2039 Opposition Report", "url": "http://winningdemocrats.com/twitter-just-wrecked-donald-trump-after-horrible-attack-on-black-communities-tweets/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://winningdemocrats.com"}

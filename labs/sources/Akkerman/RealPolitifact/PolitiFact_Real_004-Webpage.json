Bloomberg is out with a poll this morning that tracks with practically every public survey that\u2019s been released: the race for the White House is basically tied. http://bloom.bg/2dlw162 Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton in a four-way race, 43-41, and the two are tied with 46 percent in a head-to-head race.\n\nA NEW CNN poll has Hillary Clinton up one point -- 45-44 -- in Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump leads Clinton in Colorado 42-41. http://cnn.it/2dawOn3\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s with that backdrop that the nation turns to HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY on LONG ISLAND for the first matchup between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nThe debate begins at 9 p.m. and will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruption. NBC\u2019s Lester Holt is the moderator -- he\u2019s done practically no press in the leadup to what could be the biggest moment of his career. The topics for the debate are: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Direction,\u201d \u201cAchieving Prosperity\u201d and \u201cSecuring America.\u201d Clinton and Trump are scheduled to face off for a second time on Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis.

Rather than play it safe with milquetoast positions, Mrs. Clinton wants to increase turnout among African-Americans and women by tackling issues of bias and respect.

Bush\u2019s space, Richard Nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators\u2019 introductions!) and Gerald Ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, \u2018There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2cZAbAT\n\n--WSJ, Janet Hook and Andrew Ackerman, \u201cPresidential Debates Will Be a Major Influence for a Third of Voters, Poll Says\u201d: \u201cSome 34% say matchups between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be very important in picking a candidate to support\u201d: \u201cAbout 11% of voters are considered \u2018debate persuadables\u2019 -- that is, they think the debates are important and are either third-party voters or only loosely committed to either major-party candidate. Slightly more Republicans than Democrats said the debates would be important to them, 37% to 31%.

Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, seemed to side with the Republican nominee, saying in a television interview that \u2018it\u2019s not a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\u2019 She added, however, that ultimately it will be up to Monday\u2019s moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, to do the job as he sees fit.\u201d http://wapo.st/2cZsVVJ\n\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN says it\u2019s hosting more than 1,200 debate watch parties in 50 states.

Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She\u2019s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He\u2019s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\n\u201c1.

One reality they\u2019re unlikely to note: Whoever wins in November will enjoy far less latitude to spend money or cut taxes than any president since World War II.

Just six weeks after he dropped out \u2013 and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention \u2013 the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texan\u2019s own political future. ... [A]n email rate sheet obtained by POLITICO shows that Cruz asks campaigns to pay more than $22,000 for the right to send a single email his list of 280,000 digital donors.

Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian \u2018hatred and violence\u2019 for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts.\n\n\u201cNot to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, \u2018any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\u2019 \u2026 The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters.

From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd\n\nAIR WARS -- \u201cCoal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign,\u201d by Josh Gerstein: \u201cFor the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C.

In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ...\n\n\u201c[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative.

The two million women and men who work for America's banks safeguard $12.9 trillion in deposits and originate $2.4 trillion in home loans. They provide $331 billion in loans to small businesses and $175 billion in loans to farmers and ranchers. Banks' fraud protection measures stop at least $11 billion in attempted fraud each year. And thousands of banker volunteers deliver financial literacy lessons annually to millions of young Americans to help them become financially successful adults.

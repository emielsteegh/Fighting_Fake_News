Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the \"result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight\n\nMitch McConnell is playing hardball \u2014 forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.\n\nWith spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats \u2014 yet still isn\u2019t enough to get the minority party on board.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.\n\nThe new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday \u2014 which funds the government until Dec. 9 \u2014 also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.\n\n\u201cThere have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve just offered,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn\u2019t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\u201cTo put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. \"I haven\u2019t counted votes but our caucus isn\u2019t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.\"\n\nIt also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank\u2019s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.\n\n\u201cThe president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn\u2019t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.\n\nYet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika \"with no political riders.\"\n\n\"While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,\" Nelson said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,\u201d Reid told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she\u2019s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It\u2019s really unfair to the American people.\u201d\n\nDuring her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, \u201cin my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.\u201d\n\nMaryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a \u201cRepublican-only bill\" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want \"low drama\" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed.\n\n\"I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.\"\n\nHeather Caygle, Louis Nelson, Burgess Everett and Ashley Gold contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Burgess Everett", "Seung Min Kim", "Ben Weyl"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats.", "title": "McConnell plays hardball in spending fight", "url": "http://politi.co/2de5NSM", "image": "http://static.politico.com/ae/2d/1a0119fa45b89d4c83fc82a3079a/160713-mcconnell-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/mitch-mcconnell-budget-bill-228528", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/ae/2d/1a0119fa45b89d4c83fc82a3079a/160713-mcconnell-gty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/a3bec51/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fae%2F2d%2F1a0119fa45b89d4c83fc82a3079a%2F160713-mcconnell-gty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "McConnell plays hardball in spending fight", "url": "http://politi.co/2cGf4xO", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474552728000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

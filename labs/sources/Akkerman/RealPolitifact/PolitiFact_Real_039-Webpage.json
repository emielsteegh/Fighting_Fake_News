It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig\u2019s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. \u201cWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,\u201d Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. \u201cHe stands for everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Sarah B\u00fchler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town\u2019s main square. B\u00fchler is a former local \u201cwine princess,\u201d the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town\u2019s annual festival: Saumagen-D\u00f6ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. \u201cEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,\u201d says B\u00fchler. \u201cPink, purple, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that we really don\u2019t give a damn about Trump,\u201d says Huber. \u201cHe\u2019s never been here, and he apparently doesn\u2019t care about us, either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDonald\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner\u2019s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cDromb\u201d and \u201cTrumpff,\u201d according to local historians, or even \u201cDrumpf,\u201d according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. \u201cBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,\u201d said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship \u201cas his own request\u201d four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. \u201cMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended \u201cto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,\u201d he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair\u2019s family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was \u201cto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife \u2014 pregnant once more \u2014 had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n\u201c[The authorities] said, \u2018You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,\u201d says Walter. \u201cSo they left and they went back to America, and that\u2019s why Donald and I are here.\u201d\n\nFriedrich \u2014 now named Frederick \u2014 died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on \u201cKings of Kallstadt,\u201d a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump\u2019s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower\u2019s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump\u2019s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. \u201cHis assistant just couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHello, John,\u201d Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin\u2019s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. \u201cAfterwards, I just kept on thinking, \u2018What on earth did I do?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe cake looks really good,\u201d Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. \u201cThey grow them well in Kallstadt,\u201d he told her during their meeting. \u201cThey grow them very well. Believe me. It\u2019s good stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt?\u201d Wendel asked him.\n\n\u201cKallstadt?\u201d Trump Junior replied, \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Janosch Delcker"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "In the idyllic hamlet of Kallstadt, there once lived a man named Friedrich Trump.

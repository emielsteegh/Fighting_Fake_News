Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%.\n\nIn a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%.\n\nThe poll was conducted after a rough patch for Clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\n\nDespite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc.\n\nOn the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). Trump and Clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%).\n\nA new CNN Poll of Polls, including the NBC/WSJ data, finds Clinton's edge over Trump has inched up by 1 point. The Poll of Polls averages the results of the five most recent nationwide telephone polls of presidential preference among likely voters and finds her ahead, 43% to 40%.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 992 likely voters between September 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.", "authors": ["Daniella Diaz"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday.", "pubdate": "2016-09-21T21:56:05Z", "author": "Daniella Diaz, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday.", "pubdate": "2016-09-21T21:56:05Z", "title": "National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6 points", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/nbc-wsj-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2016-election/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160912160810-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-composite-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160912160810-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-composite-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-app-destination-hub,art-vid-vls-col,col-donald-trump-vs.-hillary-clinton", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/nbc-wsj-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2016-election/index.html"}, "keywords": "hillary clinton, donald trump, poll, politics, Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 6 points, according to national poll - CNNPolitics", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/daniellamicaeladiaz"}, "lastmod": "2016-09-22T15:04:16Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160912160810-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-composite-super-tease.jpg", "description": "Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6 points"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/nbc-wsj-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2016-election/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161127165012-donald-trump-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150105203929-american-flag-0105-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161108195056-mother-daughter-voting-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161122083856-trump-hillary-hand-shake-2nd-debate-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150701104517-donald-trump-file-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161109000800-hillary-clinton-headquarters-crowd-reaction-crying-leaving-keilar-00012001-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161108212222-cnn-9p-projection-election-night-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161108225000-01-split-reactions-1108-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161018105950-03-hillary-clinton-file-1011-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161122083855-trump-clinton-split-1122-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161109000043-donald-trump-florida-projection-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160912160810-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-composite-super-tease.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161108154032-donald-trump-lawsuit-nevada-voting-sot-00014011-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161109010529-van-jones-best-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922134912-06-trump-clinton-split-0921-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161122160156-03-donald-trump-nty-1122-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150105203929-american-flag-0105-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161108223616-trump-wins-ohio-large-169.jpg"], "title": "Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 6 points, according to national poll", "url": "http://cnn.it/2cRGTGk", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}

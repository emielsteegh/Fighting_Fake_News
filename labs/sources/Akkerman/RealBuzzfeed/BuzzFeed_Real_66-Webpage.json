Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,\u201d Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was \"wrong.\")\n\nObama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.\n\nThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012\n\n\"When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,\" Obama said, \"that worries me.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is \"naturally occurring.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Brianna Ehley", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Obama touted Clinton\u2019s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying \u201cshe\u2019s serious and does her homework.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Obama touted Clinton\u2019s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying \u201cshe\u2019s serious and does her homework.\u201d", "title": "Obama weighs in on the debate", "url": "http://politi.co/2d1aa0D", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3676/1155968404_5143747447001_5143712894001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/brianna.ehley"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-debate-performance-obama-228796", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3676/1155968404_5143747447001_5143712894001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Obama weighs in on the debate", "url": "http://politi.co/2dpdeXp", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474984149000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

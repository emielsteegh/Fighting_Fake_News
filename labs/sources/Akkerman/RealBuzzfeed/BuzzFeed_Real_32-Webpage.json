He even went after Trump\u2019s enablers who were sitting in the audience.\n\nKimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood\u2019s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we\u2019re one of their closest friends.\u201d\n\nBut his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.\n\nKimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.\u201d\n\nAnd when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us \u2018Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don\u2019t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we\u2019re living in one. Thank you, Mark.\u201d\n\nPerhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That\u2019s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump\u2019s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.\n\nWatch the segment

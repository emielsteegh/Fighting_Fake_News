I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it\u2019s a presidential virtue,\u201d Conway told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe Tuesday. \u201cTo tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton \u2018I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.\u2019 That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith just minutes left in Monday night\u2019s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as \u201ca man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.\u201d After the debate, Trump told CNN that \u201c\u201cI was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,\u201d indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton\u2019s husband and daughter in the audience.\n\nTuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump\u2019s attack might have been.\n\n\u201cI think he could have said what was on millions of Americans\u2019 minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who\u2019s been good to women and who hasn't?\u201d Conway said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.\u201d\n\nOverall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a \u201cknockout punch\u201d that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump\u2019s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Conway said.\n\n\u201cI don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;Certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end,&quot; she says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;Certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end,&quot; she says.", "title": "Trump camp: \u2018Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2cytmQm", "image": "http://static.politico.com/b3/b4/aa7c3c41406e99c0682c5ad45c57/20160927-kellyanne-conway-ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-first-debate-performance-campaign-react-228764", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/11e595e/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb3%2Fb4%2Faa7c3c41406e99c0682c5ad45c57%2F20160927-kellyanne-conway-ap.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "http://static.politico.com/b3/b4/aa7c3c41406e99c0682c5ad45c57/20160927-kellyanne-conway-ap.jpg"], "title": "Trump camp: \u2018Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2doygoM", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474960666000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

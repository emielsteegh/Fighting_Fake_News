Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.\n\n\u201cShe shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat \u2014 who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. \u201cHillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat added. \u201cPresidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.\u201d\n\nOne Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,\u201d said the Ohio Democrat. \u201cShe will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.\n\n\u201cSomehow she needs to reverse the trend,\u201d said an Ohio Republican. \u201cNever seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance \u2014 and maybe her last chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has to stop [Trump\u2019s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,\u201d added a Virginia Republican. \u201cAll [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.\u201d\n\nAmong those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure \u2014 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans \u2014 most pointed to the GOP nominee\u2019s volatile personality.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,\u201d said a Michigan Republican. \u201cThe pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?\u201d added a Michigan Democrat. \u201cCan he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?\u201d\n\nTwo other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:\n\nMost insiders expect Clinton to \u201cwin\u201d the debate.\n\nMajorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u201cMedia look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,\u201d said an Iowa Republican.\n\n\u201c[Clinton\u2019s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,\u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nBut not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton \u2014 or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.\n\n\u201cThe press wants Trump to win,\u201d said a Florida Democrat. \u201cTheir disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans also claimed media bias \u2014 in the other direction.\n\n\u201cThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,\u201d a Virginia Republican said. \u201cBut then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.\u201d\n\nInsiders think the debate will matter.\n\nAsked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.\n\nAmong Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don\u2019t expect the debate to move the needle.\n\n\u201cTrump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),\u201d a Michigan Democrat predicted. \u201cThe moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.\u201d\n\nThe numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn\u2019t have a significant impact.\n\n\u201cTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,\u201d said a New Hampshire Republican. \u201cHe does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump\u2019s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.\n\n\u201cIf she pins his ears back, [it helps her],\u201d said an Iowa Republican. \u201cIf it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.\u201d\n\nOther insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.\n\n\u201cWe're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,\u201d an Iowa Republican said. \u201cSwing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.\u201d\n\nAdded a Florida Democrat: \u201cDoes a damn thing matter this year? I think not.\u201d\n\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\n\nColorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer\n\nFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.\n\nHe said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States \"may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.\"\n\nJames Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.\n\n\"I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,\" he said.\n\n\"It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,\" Campbell added.", "authors": ["More Meghan", "Abc News"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say", "description": "Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however.", "title": "Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however.", "title": "Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@mkeneally", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-19", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-19", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-19 18:04:32", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997", "images": ["http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"], "title": "Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}

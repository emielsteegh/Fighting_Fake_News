We can \u2014 you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.\u2019 No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they\u2019re registered \u201cbecause I need you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta stand up and be counted in this election,\u201d she added.\n\nClinton\u2019s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that\u2019s on the ballot right now.\u201d\n\nBut up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.\n\n\u201cI am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we\u2019ve seen coming from my opponent,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I\u2019ve been at this and, you know, I understand it\u2019s a contact sport.\u201d\n\nWhat Clinton won\u2019t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. \u201cYou know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s just something we cannot tolerate,\u201d she said.\n\nAs Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: \u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary \u2014 see you at the debate!\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cWe gotta stand up and be counted in this election,\u201d she added.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cWe gotta stand up and be counted in this election,\u201d she added.", "title": "Clinton: \u2018The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2d1Uwok", "image": "http://static.politico.com/49/14/53e2365742a1b9469034f59209de/08-hillary-clinton-1-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NolanDMcCaskill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clinton-whats-at-stake-in-2016-election-228404", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/4cbc8c6/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F49%2F14%2F53e2365742a1b9469034f59209de%2F08-hillary-clinton-1-ap-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "http://static.politico.com/49/14/53e2365742a1b9469034f59209de/08-hillary-clinton-1-ap-1160.jpg"], "title": "Clinton: \u2018The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2cmo9Qd", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474367623000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

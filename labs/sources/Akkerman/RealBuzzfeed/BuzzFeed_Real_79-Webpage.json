I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,\" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the \"larger issue\" is the Clinton Foundation.\n\nWilliams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for \"what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging\" from the latest Post story.\n\n\"Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.\"\n\nPence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out,&quot; Pence says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out,&quot; Pence says.", "title": "Pence gives no specifics on why Trump Foundation story is inaccurate", "url": "http://politi.co/2cH2ZL1", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/362/1155968404_5135180646001_5135157700001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-foundation-washington-post-pence-228454", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/362/1155968404_5135180646001_5135157700001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Pence gives no specifics on why Trump Foundation story is inaccurate", "url": "http://politi.co/2d1BwU6", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474445384000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

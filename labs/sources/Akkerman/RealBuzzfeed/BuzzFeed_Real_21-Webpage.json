Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThat declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly \u2014 in part responding to Trump\u2019s attacks on his wife and father.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump\u2019s tax returns could show a mob connection\n\nIn February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn\u2019t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d suggesting that they might show \u201cDonald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there\u2019s a bombshell there,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to wonder, \u2018Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?\u2019\u201d\n\n2. In March, Cruz called him a \u201csniveling coward\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on the senator\u2019s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, \u201cDonald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to tick me off. I don\u2019t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n3. He also called Trump a \u201cbig, loud New York bully\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,\u201d Cruz said . \u201cIt is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.\u201d\n\n4. Also, \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.\u201d\n\n5. Cruz called one of Trump\u2019s theories \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201cjust kooky\u201d\n\nIn May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz\u2019s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: \u201cThis morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let\u2019s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.\u201d\n\n6. He also called him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who \u201clies practically every word that comes out of his mouth\u201d\n\nAlso in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\u201d\n\n7. And Cruz was specific with the term \u201cpathological\u201d: Trump is \u201cutterly amoral,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he\u2019d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he\u2019s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,\u201d Cruz said .\n\n8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d\n\nContinuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : \u201cHe combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, \u2018Dude, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd: \u201cDonald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He\u2019s proud of being a serial philanderer.\u201d\n\n9. In July, Cruz still hadn\u2019t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family\n\n\u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\u201d Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.\n\nReferring to his pledge to support his party\u2019s nominee, Cruz said that statement \u201cwas not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog\" and support him.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Madeline Conway", "Burgess Everett", "Katie Glueck", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The Texas senator's endorsement comes after he openly disparaged Donald Trump repeatedly.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Texas senator's endorsement comes after he openly disparaged Donald Trump repeatedly.", "title": "9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him", "url": "http://politi.co/2dgVZYf", "image": "http://static.politico.com/89/08/33b4aa9842b5af9d355e1ac415de/160923-ted-cruz-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/ted-cruz-donald-trump-insults-endorse-228594", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/89/08/33b4aa9842b5af9d355e1ac415de/160923-ted-cruz-gty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/f7ded1e/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F89%2F08%2F33b4aa9842b5af9d355e1ac415de%2F160923-ted-cruz-gty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him", "url": "http://politi.co/2cSUHmo", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474649129000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

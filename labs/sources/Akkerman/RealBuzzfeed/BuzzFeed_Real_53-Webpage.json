Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.\n\nBut all we\u2019re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.\n\nWhat is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?\n\nTo those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.

He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. \u201cIt\u2019s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story\u2019s a little bit different as to how it\u2019s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an officer, you\u2019re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? If a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? How does that even make sense?\n\nOh that\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t. Of course, that doesn\u2019t stop progressives from declaring that they know exactly how things should be happening. You know, with their degrees in women\u2019s studies and art history, they\u2019re clearly the most qualified people to be criticizing the actions of our law enforcement.", "authors": ["Sierra Marlee"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police.

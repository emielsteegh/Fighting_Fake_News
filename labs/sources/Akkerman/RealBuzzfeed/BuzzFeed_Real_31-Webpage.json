The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.\n\nOfficials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.\n\nBut the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Barbara Starr", "Cnn Pentagon Correspondent"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.", "pubdate": "2016-09-19T19:03:08Z", "author": "Barbara Starr, CNN Pentagon Correspondent", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.", "pubdate": "2016-09-19T19:03:08Z", "title": "US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/syria-coalition-airstrike/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160408165549-syrian-pro-government-march-25-2016-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160408165549-syrian-pro-government-march-25-2016-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-us-military,art-vid-vls-col,col-crisis-in-syria", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/syria-coalition-airstrike/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike - CNNPolitics", "lastmod": "2016-11-30T03:05:04Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160408165549-syrian-pro-government-march-25-2016-super-tease.jpg", "description": "The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/syria-coalition-airstrike/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160408165549-syrian-pro-government-march-25-2016-super-tease.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917171131-syria-us-led-airstrike-barbara-starr-beeper-00004411-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161216212705-aleppo-refugee-turkey-2-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405132549-01-donald-trump-king-abdullah-ii-0405-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405142252-trump-4-05-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405090758-rubio-putin-war-criminal-large-169.jpg", "http://i.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/3.0/branding/logos/us-military-logo-large.png", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161215113641-05-aleppo-1215-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161216154327-aleppo-evacuations-smart-news-agency-2-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170313165131-syria-unicef-children-1-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405160728-kassem-eid-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405122926-jordan-king-abdullah-trump-white-house-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161223164416-01-women-of-2016-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170407151517-syria-key-players-3-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170624140053-04-israel-syria-golan-heights-strike-0624-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404114821-01-idlib-chemical-attack-0404-large-169.jpg", "http://i.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/3.0/branding/backgrounds/us-military-background-full.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917171131-syria-us-led-airstrike-barbara-starr-beeper-00004411-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160815095344-chemical-weapons-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170413091435-02-bashar-al-assad-screengrab-large-169.jpg"], "title": "US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike", "url": "http://cnn.it/2dbAvI9", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}

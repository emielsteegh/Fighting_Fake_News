Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.\n\nIt was just another day in Trump\u2019s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities \"are absolutely in the worst shape that they\u2019ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King \u2014 who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a \u201cgladiator.\u201d King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.\n\n\u201cThe system is the problem, and he\u2019s the only gladiator that will take on the system,\u201d King said.\n\nAfter the church event, Trump sat for a \u201ctown hall\u201d with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community,\u201d Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.\n\n\u201cWe did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nBut even before Trump\u2019s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his \u201cever, ever, ever\u201d remark Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,\u201d Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. \u201cIs he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination \u2014 when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal \u2014 in the low single digits \u2014 and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks \u2014 \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he says \u2014 to largely white audiences.\n\nAt the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.\n\nSeated to Trump\u2019s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (\u201cthere\u2019s only one,\u201d Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (\u201ctough\u201d), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (\u201ca tough general\u201d) and former \"Apprentice\" star Omarosa Manigault (\u201ca wonderful woman\u201d), who has helped with Trump\u2019s black outreach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,\u201d Trump said from the pulpit.\n\nTrump, who has called himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been \u201cchoking\u201d in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.\n\n\"Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?\u201d\n\nKing, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.\n\nKing, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that \u201cthe system\u201d had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.\n\n\u201cEvery white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,\u201d said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro \u2014 I would use the N-word \u2014 but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,\u201d King said.\n\nWhen Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, \u201cAh, there\u2019s only one Don King.\u201d\n\nBefore King, Cohen, Trump\u2019s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the \u201cdisgusting, liberal, mainstream media\u201d and its casting of Trump as a \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word of the 2016 election has somehow become \u2018racist,\u2019\u201d Cohen complained. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let\u2019s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d\n\nCohen said, \u201cNot only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThey come and they take your vote,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand they say they\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Louis Nelson", "Matthew Nussbaum", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The Republican nominee brought together an eclectic group of surrogates to pitch him to women and minorities.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Republican nominee brought together an eclectic group of surrogates to pitch him to women and minorities.", "title": "Trump\u2019s puzzling pitch to black voters", "url": "http://politi.co/2dbc2GW", "image": "http://static.politico.com/f8/4f/00fe12244f809df3cf4b53864559/160921-donald-trump-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/is-trump-racist-228472", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/f8/4f/00fe12244f809df3cf4b53864559/160921-donald-trump-gty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/2ec857c/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ff8%2F4f%2F00fe12244f809df3cf4b53864559%2F160921-donald-trump-gty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump\u2019s puzzling pitch to black voters", "url": "http://politi.co/2cRQmvU", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474460641000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

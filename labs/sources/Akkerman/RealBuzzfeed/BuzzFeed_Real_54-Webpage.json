He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,\" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. \"As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.\"\n\nKaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.\n\nLater Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.\n\nKaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Burgess Everett"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.", "title": "Kaine visits site of Orlando mass shooting", "url": "http://politi.co/2dmhZRa", "image": "http://static.politico.com/30/9c/6ff3a1f345c89c00c01b2791220a/160926-tim-kaine-orlando-nm-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/kaine-orlando-shooting-228698", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/30/9c/6ff3a1f345c89c00c01b2791220a/160926-tim-kaine-orlando-nm-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55ac911/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F30%2F9c%2F6ff3a1f345c89c00c01b2791220a%2F160926-tim-kaine-orlando-nm-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Kaine visits site of Orlando mass shooting", "url": "http://politi.co/2d1z7fz", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474912644000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

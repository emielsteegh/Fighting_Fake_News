Polling averages now show that Clinton\u2019s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a \u201cdead heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,\u201d Silver tweeted.\n\nDuring the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton\u2019s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, \u201cthat that simply be checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump\u2019s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he\u2019s a Democrat and the system is \u201cvery unfair.\u201d The \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he knew what Lester Holt\u2019s voter registration was,\u201d said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Conway said at one point, explaining that \u201ca lie would mean that he knew the man\u2019s party registration.\u201d\n\nIn a presidential cycle that\u2019s seen endless debates about debates, Monday\u2019s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn\u2019t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s campaign has beat up on Holt\u2019s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump\u2019s false assertion that he didn\u2019t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.\n\nView One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. \u201cIn our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,\u201d Janet Brown, the commission\u2019s executive director, told CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Clinton won\u2019t let Trump\u2019s lies \u201cgo by the wayside,\u201d press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn\u2019t, either.\n\n\u201cThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,\u201d he said. \u201cLester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates\u2019 performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can\u2019t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.\n\n\u201cI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns \u2014 and what it should be \u2014 is that the moderator is not the person who\u2019s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hold people accountable, there\u2019s no question, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they\u2019re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp\u2019s preparation for two Trumps.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Donald Trump\u2019s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We\u2019re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,\u201d Mook told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nAsked about Clinton\u2019s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that \u201cit just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nView One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nBut Conway shot down the notion that there\u2019s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is \u201cto become human\u201d during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that \u201cOverprogramming leads to short circuits,\u201d and Conway joined the pile-on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven\u2019t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.\u201d\n\nAfter Mook warned against \u201ca double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,\u201d Conway added that the two campaign managers \u201care living in parallel universes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it\u2019s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn\u2019t necessarily been beneficial.\u201d\n\nAside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton\u2019s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they\u2019re conclusions in search of evidence,\u201d Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,\u201d Conway said. \u201cNinety-two percent of at least two of our embeds\u2019 tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can\u2019t get a fair shake from certain people.\u201d\n\nConway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cSo if she ends up saying to him, \u2018That\u2019s just not true, you\u2019re distorting my record, you\u2019re being mean to a woman,\u2019 and then people will say, \u2018He was mean to a woman,\u2019 and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up \u2014 even if it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that would be my concern, that he\u2019s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she\u2019s not a great debater, that she\u2019s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she\u2019s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to \"just let loose\" and be himself \u2014 and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.\n\n\"She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox and Friends.\" \"So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be \u2014 he's just going to be like you see him on \u2014 when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Steven Shepard", "Glenn Thrush", "Nolan D", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The Clinton and Trump camps are still sparring over the basic rules of the game.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Clinton and Trump camps are still sparring over the basic rules of the game.", "title": "Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate", "url": "http://politi.co/2dl3YmI", "image": "http://static.politico.com/e6/39/fd05beec4b3bbe9db806e2ff1141/20160926-debate-prep-ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NolanDMcCaskill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clinton-trump-fight-2016-pre-debate-228669", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/a575319/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe6%2F39%2Ffd05beec4b3bbe9db806e2ff1141%2F20160926-debate-prep-ap.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/e6/39/fd05beec4b3bbe9db806e2ff1141/20160926-debate-prep-ap.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate", "url": "http://politi.co/2d0l760", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474885803000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

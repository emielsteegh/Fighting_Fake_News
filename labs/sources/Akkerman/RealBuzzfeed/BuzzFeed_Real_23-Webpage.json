He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,\u201d Obama said once he took the podium. \u201cI have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn\u2019t steal mine. She would, too. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we\u2019ve developed over the last eight years,\u201d he added.\n\nThe unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander\u2019s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.\n\nObama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy\u2019s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the general rule: You don\u2019t put stuff on your head if you\u2019re president,\u201d Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. \u201cThat\u2019s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders.", "title": "Obama wears hat, breaking \u2018Politics 101\u2019 rule on headgear", "url": "http://politi.co/2cx9P2y", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1540/1155968404_5142194641001_5142158442001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/barack-obama-wears-hat-president-228693", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1540/1155968404_5142194641001_5142158442001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Obama wears hat, breaking \u2018Politics 101\u2019 rule on headgear", "url": "http://politi.co/2dbESny", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474908937000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

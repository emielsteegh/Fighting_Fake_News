I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Tuesday morning. \u201cTo bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.\u201d\n\nThe issue of Trump\u2019s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night\u2019s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said \u201cWell, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].\u201d\n\nBrazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is \u201cnot forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, \u2018I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.\u2019 It's amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It\u2019s the wound that won't heal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cI think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this,&quot; she says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cI think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this,&quot; she says.", "title": "Donna Brazile slams Trump for not apologizing for birther claims", "url": "http://politi.co/2doHLop", "image": "http://static.politico.com/b5/be/fed7973e4fcb9fa148be44c4b892/donna-brazile-ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-debate-birther-donna-brazile-228781", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/b5/be/fed7973e4fcb9fa148be44c4b892/donna-brazile-ap.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/7aa6fc7/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2Fbe%2Ffed7973e4fcb9fa148be44c4b892%2Fdonna-brazile-ap.jpg"], "title": "Donna Brazile slams Trump for not apologizing for birther claims", "url": "http://politi.co/2cSX97k", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474974570000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.\n\n\"There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\"\n\nThe Democratic nominee added: \"I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\"\n\nEven as she referred to the deaths as \"two very upsetting incidents,\" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Mj Lee", "Cnn National Politics Reporter"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are \"unbearable\" and \"intolerable.\"", "pubdate": "2016-09-21T20:47:51Z", "author": "MJ Lee, CNN National Politics Reporter", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are \"unbearable\" and \"intolerable.\"", "pubdate": "2016-09-21T20:47:51Z", "title": "Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have'", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/hillary-clinton-police-shootings-terence-crutcher-keith-lamont-scott/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160914164646-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160914164646-hillary-clinton-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-vls-col,col-hillary-clinton", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/hillary-clinton-police-shootings-terence-crutcher-keith-lamont-scott/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have' -

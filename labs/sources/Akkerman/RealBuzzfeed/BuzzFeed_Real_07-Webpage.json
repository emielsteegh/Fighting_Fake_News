And I never felt this way until now and I can\u2019t stand how we\u2019re treated,\u201d the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nShe expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn\u2019t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,\u201d she said.\n\nZianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted \"no justice, no peace\" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina\u2019s most populous city since the shooting.\n\nProtests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nThe scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.\n\nAt the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.\n\nAfter the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.\n\n\u201cRelease. Release. The whole damn tape,\u201d the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nRay Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.\n\nChief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.", "authors": ["More Michael", "Abc News"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting", "description": "Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears...", "title": "Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears...", "title": "Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@MichaelEHayden", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-27", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-27", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-27 15:03:26", "keywords": "Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939", "images": ["http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg"], "title": "Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}

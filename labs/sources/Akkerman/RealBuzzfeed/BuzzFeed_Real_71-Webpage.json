However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?\n\nHere\u2019s The Huffington Post to answer that question:\n\nAre polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday\u2019s debate? \u2014 Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016\n\nWhy is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet\u2019s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night\u2019s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.\n\nOf course, the Trumpkins aren\u2019t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:\n\n@HuffingtonPost someone\u2019s upset that #Trumpwins \u2014 Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016\n\n@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? \u2014 Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016\n\nHope no one at Clemson got triggered for seeing this racist tweet. @HuffingtonPost pic.twitter.com/0KxxsNnMh5 \u2014 Michael Benson (@KeyMrB) September 27, 2016\n\n@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y \u2014 Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016\n\nAnd, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn\u2019t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:\n\nI won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate \u2013 except for the little watched @CNN poll. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016\n\nThe #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon \u2013 thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016\n\nSuch a great honor. Final debate polls are in \u2013 and the MOVEMENT wins!#AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYouhttps://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016\n\nHe tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, \u201cMajority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN\u2019s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.\u201d They actually looks like they\u2019re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.\n\nSelf-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.\n\nFeatured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images", "authors": ["Rika Christensen"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Online polls are completely meaningless, and this is why.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Rika Christensen", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Online polls are completely meaningless, and this is why.", "title": "HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night\u2019s Debate", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/27/huffpo-just-dropped-the-mic-on-internet-polls-saying-trump-crushed-hillary-in-last-nights-debate/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-HuffPo.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Online polls are completely meaningless, and this is why.", "title": "HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night's Debate", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/27/huffpo-just-dropped-the-mic-on-internet-polls-saying-trump-crushed-hillary-in-last-nights-debate/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-HuffPo.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Liberalistics/"}, "keywords": "2016 Election, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, presidential debate, presidential election, The Huffington Post", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/27/huffpo-just-dropped-the-mic-on-internet-polls-saying-trump-crushed-hillary-in-last-nights-debate/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-HuffPo.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8197cffc1775c0def315ada1338524cb?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night\u2019s Debate", "url": "http://addictinginfo.org/2016/09/27/huffpo-just-dropped-the-mic-on-internet-polls-saying-trump-crushed-hillary-in-last-nights-debate/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474934400000}, "source": "http://addictinginfo.org"}

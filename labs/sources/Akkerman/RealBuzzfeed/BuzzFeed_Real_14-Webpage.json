Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party\u2019s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here next week. We\u2019re probably going to have some downtime,\u201d Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!\n\nBut America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney\u2019s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat\u2019s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:\n\nMinority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is \u201cethically compromised\u201d and the \u201cking of the welfare kings.\u201d\n\nIronically, Romney\u2019s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.\n\nAmerican voters deserve to know what\u2019s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!", "authors": ["Grant Stern", "Brett Bose", "Natalie Dickinson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Occupy Democrats", "description": "What are you hiding, Mr. Trump?", "title": "Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 399, "identifier": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/image-31.jpeg", "height": 225}, "url": "http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/09/23/senate-dems-move-force-trump-release-tax-returns/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/image-31.jpeg", "creator": "@grantstern", "description": "What are you hiding, Mr. Trump?", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns"}, "fb": {"admins": "100010978633754 , 66801782", "app_id": 187891551586426}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/odfavicon-2.gif", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "style", "published_time": "2016-09-23T02:18:38-04:00", "author": "https://facebook.com/grantstern"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/09/23/senate-dems-move-force-trump-release-tax-returns/", "images": ["http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/od-political-WEBSITE-SIDEBAR-SMALL.png", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Bye-Bye-Trump-240x150.png", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/nytimes-2-340x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/cher-1-240x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/jklol-340x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Trump-Niinisto-340x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupydemocrats-logo2x.png", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-4.07.01-PM.png", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Bakker-340x150.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6d91f94d3316d0ac53c3711f04f38fca?s=164&d=mm&r=g", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumppence-3-340x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/image-31.jpeg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/donald-trump-with-felix-sater-240x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/sallyyates-240x150.jpg", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/DrunkTrump-240x150.png", "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2017-08-29-at-3.42.57-PM-340x150.png"], "title": "Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns", "url": "http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/09/23/senate-dems-move-force-trump-release-tax-returns/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474588800000}, "source": "http://occupydemocrats.com"}

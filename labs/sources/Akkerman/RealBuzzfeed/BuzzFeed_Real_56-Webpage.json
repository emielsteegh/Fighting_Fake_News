He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.\n\nBut lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.\n\nTrump is saying \u201cyes\u201d to Fox News almost every day but saying \u201cno\u201d to most other major networks and news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday morning, he is booked on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate\u2019s exposure to hard-hitting questions \u2014 while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nAt Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won\u2019t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn\u2019t challenged \u2013 and that\u2019s the way he wants it.\n\nThe problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn\u2019t reaching out.\n\nIt is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in \u201cswing\u201d districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.\n\nOn election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney \u201clandslide\u201d the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.\n\nFeatured image via Flickr", "authors": ["Oliver Willis"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Trump is hiding from the media like a total coward, and this is why it could be a disaster for him.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Oliver Willis", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Trump is hiding from the media like a total coward, and this is why it could be a disaster for him.", "title": "How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/how-trump-is-hiding-from-the-media-like-a-total-coward/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/27484886630_7f5ec68aaa_k.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump is hiding from the media like a total coward, and this is why it could be a disaster for him.", "title": "How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/how-trump-is-hiding-from-the-media-like-a-total-coward/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/27484886630_7f5ec68aaa_k.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "2016 Election, Donald Trump, Fox News, Media", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/how-trump-is-hiding-from-the-media-like-a-total-coward/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/27484886630_7f5ec68aaa_k.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a922443535caa967b15e18639ed76c4?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/20/how-trump-is-hiding-from-the-media-like-a-total-coward/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474329600000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

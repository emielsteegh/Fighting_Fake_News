Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I\u2019m pretty much baffled.\n\nThe problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses\u2014especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: \u201cYou\u2019ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you\u2019re one of those who\u2019s created the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIndeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I\u2019ve called \u201cpolitical judo\u201d\u2014turning an opponent\u2019s strength against her. (\u201cYes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that\u2019s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy\u2019s chief speechwriter, are backing me.\u201d)\n\nFurther, there's a sense\u2014a highly limited sense\u2014in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, \u201cI'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.\u201d It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).\n\nBy contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers\u2014assuming they exist\u2014to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump\u2014bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post\u2014but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump\u2014and he's still standing.\n\nDoes any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don\u2019t do, based on a half-century or so of history.\n\nThe Focus Is on \u201cMoments\u201d\u2014But They\u2019re Not Always The Key\n\nAsk any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:\n\n\u201cNixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter \u2018there you go again,\u2019 then asked Americans \u2018are you better off?\u2019 Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale\u2019s \u2018youth and inexperience.\u2019 Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife\u2019s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.\u201d\n\nThese are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It\u2019s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines\u2014\u201czingers\u201d\u2014to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It\u2019s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, \u201cYou\u2019ve all become theater critics.\u201d)\n\nBut in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it\u2019s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the \u201daha!\u201d moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama\u2019s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president\u2019s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.\n\nThe presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a \u201cmoment\u201d unlike any in debate history; that\u2019s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: \u201che seemed pretty reasonable\u201d or \u201cshe knows what she\u2019s talking about and he doesn\u2019t.\u201d This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.\n\nThere Are Three Debates, Not One\u2014And That Can Matter A Whole Lot\n\nOne key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th\u2014barely a week before the election.\n\nEvery other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That\u2019s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it\u2019s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.\n\nHere, I think, is an opening for Clinton\u2014especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question\u2014and they are usually very lame \"what can you do for my daughter?\" questions\u2014into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump\u2019s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush\u2019s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: \"What about Dingell-Norwood?\" The opportunity for her is to argue\u2014from experience\u2014that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format\u2014with dozens of \u201creal\u201d people as participants\u2014makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).\n\nTrump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo\n\nThe potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthey've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.\u201d\n\nJudo, however, can cut both ways. There\u2019s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.\n\n\u201cWell, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don\u2019t know because you\u2019re the first presidential candidate ever who won\u2019t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who\u2019s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn\u2019t start with millions from his father, says you\u2019re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit\u2014you\u2019re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.\u201d\n\nDebates Are NOT Decisive\n\nOne last note. It\u2019s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (\u201cReagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.\u201d \u201cObama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected\u2026\u201d). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama\u2019s clear if modest popular vote victory.\n\nIn their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other \u201cgame-changers\u201d with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney\u2019s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the \u201cfundamentals\u201d\u2014economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate\u2014the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.\n\nOf course, this cycle the \u201cfundamentals\u201d point to a very close race. So you\u2019ll probably want to tune in anyway\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Jeff Greenfield"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Her greatest strength\u2014experience\u2014is also her greatest vulnerability in the first debate.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Her greatest strength\u2014experience\u2014is also her greatest vulnerability in the first debate.", "title": "Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?", "url": "http://politi.co/2dldAht", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c9/c0/fae428464ce8b51f984194f193fd/160926-greenfield-hillary-ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-2016-debate-214291", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/c9/c0/fae428464ce8b51f984194f193fd/160926-greenfield-hillary-ap.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/fc1ca12/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc9%2Fc0%2Ffae428464ce8b51f984194f193fd%2F160926-greenfield-hillary-ap.jpg"], "title": "Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?", "url": "http://politi.co/2d0FTlN", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474906020000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

What in the hell is he talking about?\" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. \"Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we\u2019re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.\"\n\nBiden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, \"saying it's good business to take advantage of people\u2019s misery, rooting for that misery?\"\n\n\"He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,\" Biden said. \"They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don\u2019t take pleasure from 'You\u2019re fired.' They don\u2019t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.\"\n\nDuring the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, \"That's called business, by the way.\"\n\n\"When you\u2019re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?\" Biden said of Trump.\n\nThe vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes \"makes me smart.\"\n\n\"He acknowledged that he didn\u2019t pay taxes because, he said, he\u2019s smart. Makes him smart,\" Biden said. \"Tell that to the janitor in here who\u2019s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.\u201d\n\nHe added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.\n\n\"If this choice isn\u2019t clear, I don\u2019t know \u2013- my lord,\" Biden said about the debate. \"What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.\"", "authors": ["Abc News", "More Arlette"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'", "description": "Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\"This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to...", "title": "Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\"This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to...", "title": "Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@arlettesaenz", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-27", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-27", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-27 15:43:23", "keywords": "abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"], "title": "Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}

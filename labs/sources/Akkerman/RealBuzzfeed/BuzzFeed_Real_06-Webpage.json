Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.\n\nWhen Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents\u2019 trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, \u201cHow are you, Donald?\u201d Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.\n\nShortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, \u201cBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,\u201d before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, \u201cYes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to be referring to his addressing her as \u201cSecretary Clinton,\u201d although it wasn\u2019t completely clear during the moment.\n\n2. Personal Attacks Came Early\n\nClinton was first to go on the attack during tonight\u2019s debate, taking aim at Trump\u2019s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.\n\n\u201cDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,\u201d Clinton said, before expanding on her father\u2019s work as a drapery maker.\n\nTrump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in \u201ctrumped up, trickle-down\u201d economics.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.\n\n3. Trading Barbs Over Trade\n\nVoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nTrump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.\n\n\u201cAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nClinton fired back, \u201cWell, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.\u201d\n\nTrump then pointed to Clinton\u2019s once referring to TPP as the \u201cgold standard of trade deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, \"TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\u201d Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that \u201cwhat I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\u201d\n\n4. Trump Asks \u2018Why Not\u2019 Blame All the World\u2019s Problems on Clinton\n\nLess than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: \"I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nClinton responded: \"Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this\u2014\u201c\n\nTrump interjected: \"There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,\u201d before the moderator reminded Trump, \"This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\"\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns\n\nTrump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cI don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,\u201d he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.\n\nTrump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. \u201cI will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?\n\n\u201cMaybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d she said.\n\n6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage\n\nModerator Lester Holt asked Trump \u201cwhat took you so long\u201d to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee\u2019s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.\n\nAt first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with when Obama released his birth certificate.\n\nHolt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it\u2019s authenticity until 2015.\n\n\u201cNobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,\u201d Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump\u2019s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. \u201cI figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.\u201d\n\nPaul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n7. Clinton Defends Being \u2018Prepared\u2019 When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail\n\nTrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,\u201d seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight\u2019s faceoff.\n\n\"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d Clinton said. \"And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\u201d\n\nThroughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.\n\n8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion\n\nTrump\u2019s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.\n\n\u201cStop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that \u201cit went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would have won an appeal,\u201d he said, noting that there was no appeal.\n\nTrump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.\n\n9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope\n\nToward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.\n\n\u201cI did not support the war in Iraq,\u201d Trump said. \"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\u201d\n\nHolt corrected him, saying, \u201cThe record shows otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\"\n\nTrump appeared to hesitate, responding, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d\n\nDespite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, \u201cThe record shows that I am right.\u201d\n\n10. Sparring Over Stamina\n\nHolt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a \u201cpresidential look,\u201d asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her \u201cstamina.\u201d\n\n\"She doesn't have the look, she doesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d Trump said. \"I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\u201d\n\nTrump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.\n\n\"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:\n\n\"One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,\u201d Clinton said. \"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\u201d", "authors": ["More Veronica", "Ryan Struyk", "More Ryan", "Meghan Keneally", "More Shushannah", "Abc News", "More Meghan", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "10 Moments That Mattered in 1st Clinton-Trump Debate", "description": "10 Moments That Mattered in 1st Clinton-Trump Debate", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.\nThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic...", "title": "10 Moments That Mattered in 1st Clinton-Trump Debate", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-debate-10-moments-mattered/story?id=42366107", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/GTY_Debate01-hb_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.\nThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic...", "title": "10 Moments That Mattered in 1st Clinton-Trump Debate", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-debate-10-moments-mattered/story?id=42366107", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/GTY_Debate01-hb_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@ryanstruyk", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42366107", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42366107", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-debate-10-moments-mattered/story?id=42366107"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-28", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42366107", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-debate-10-moments-mattered/story?id=42366107"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-debate-10-moments-mattered/story?id=42366107", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42366107", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-28", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-28 12:16:22", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, first presidential debate, debate, 2016 debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "article": {"author": "/author/meghan_keneally"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, first presidential debate, debate, 2016 debate"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-debate-10-moments-mattered/story?id=42366107", "images": ["http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_trump_handsout_ps_160926_4x3_992.jpg", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_hillary_clinton_ps2_160926_4x3_992.jpg", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/GTY_Debate01-hb_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/GTY_Debate01-hb_160926_12x5_992.jpg"], "title": "10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2d56mMD", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}

His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.\n\nPopular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.\n\nHer actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.\n\n\"As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,\" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.\n\nWhile she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.\n\nDuring a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, \"Stand up!\"\n\nPopular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:\n\nNonetheless, Rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement.\n\n\"As of now I plan to keep kneeling,\" she told ESPN. \"I'm trying to kind of formulate a better plan and an action step moving forward. But until then, this is how I can help, this is how I can use my voice going forward, and this is how I can be an ally in this space.\"", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "description": "She will now be...", "title": "Megan Rapinoe Protests National Anthem Again Despite Warning, Pays The Price", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"site_name": "Opposing Views", "description": "She will now be...", "title": "Megan Rapinoe Protests National Anthem Again Despite Warning, Pays The Price", "url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/megan-rapinoe-be-punished-over-not-standing-anthem", "image": "http://s12.postimg.org/6xgybmfxp/rapinoe.png", "type": "article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-19T14:33:44+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2016-09-19T14:33:44+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_2017/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "keywords": "Megan Rapinoe,US Soccer,Colin Kaepernick,protesting the national anthem,Megan Rapinoe could face discipline for protesting the anthem", "ov": {"id": 881781}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "news_keywords": "Megan Rapinoe,US Soccer,Colin Kaepernick,protesting the national anthem,Megan Rapinoe could face discipline for protesting the anthem"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/megan-rapinoe-be-punished-over-not-standing-anthem", "images": ["http://s12.postimg.org/6xgybmfxp/rapinoe.png", "http://www.opposingviews.com/sites/all/themes/ov_2017/img/OpposingViews.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-15e4OSeaAUAF6.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1522439921378351&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8097945&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.opposingviews.com/sites/all/themes/ov_2017/img/render-logo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=745291502309008&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://img.opposingviews.com/sites/default/files/styles/782x440/public/admin/OVDefault.jpg?itok=k4bdyP05"], "title": "Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?", "url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/megan-rapinoe-be-punished-over-not-standing-anthem?fb=rwn", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.opposingviews.com"}

In more recent years he\u2019s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.\n\nSimmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, \u201cshould go to jail and be somebody\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.\n\n\u201cNobody says the word \u2018profile.\u2019 Everyone needs to get smart. I\u2019m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I\u2019m clear, then profile someone else. It\u2019s emergency powers during war. There\u2019s a war going on.\u201d\n\nBut what about the people who were being \u201cunfairly\u201d profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. \u201cIt is unfair. That\u2019s why the words \u2018too bad\u2019 exists.\u201d\n\nBOOM.\n\nThank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he\u2019ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can\u2019t I?\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["Onan

The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.\n\nHer campaign\u2019s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.\n\nBut now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn\u2019t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary\u2019s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a \u201cPlan B.\u201d\n\nFor the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.\n\nNow, even Hillary is asking why she isn\u2019t \u201c50 points ahead\u201d of Trump?\n\nAt a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about \u201cinvesting in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,\u201d she raised the question:\n\n\u201cHaving said all this, \u2018Why aren\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\u2019 you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump\u2019s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.\u201d\n\nAt another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to \u201cstage an intervention\u201d if they know anyone who supports Trump. \u201cIf you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,\u201d she said. \u201cTry to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I\u2019ve done versus what he\u2019s done. Remember, friends don\u2019t let friends vote for Trump.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["Philip Hodges", "View All Posts"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary: \u201cIf you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention.

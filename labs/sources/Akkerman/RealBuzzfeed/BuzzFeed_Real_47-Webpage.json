The Times piece elated critics of the \"he said/she\" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled \u201cThe Death of \u2018He Said, She Said\u2019 Journalism,\u201d Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro\u2019s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they\u2019re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with \u201castonishing bluntness,\u201d Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump\u2019s birther nonsense a \u201clie.\u201d Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the \"he said/she said\" critics.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don\u2019t mind saying so, I\u2019m not convinced that jettisoning the \"he said/she said\" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn\u2019t that what the fact-checker columns are for?\n\nIn his widely applauded critiques of \"he said/she said\" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the \u201cother side\u201d of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the \u201che said\u201d voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the \u201cshe said\u201d dissent. \u201cDo users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who\u2019s faking it more?\u201d Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The \"he said/she said\" structure constitutes \u201cone of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,\u201d he would later remark.\n\nDonald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the \"he said/she said\" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he\u2019s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he\u2019s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he\u2019s used terms like \u201cfat pig\u201d to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump\u2019s \u201cshe said\u201d lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the \u201che said\u201d side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.\n\nBut has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, \"he said/she said\" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump\u2019s \u201cpost-truth\u201d style of politics and don\u2019t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don\u2019t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster\u2019s campaign he\u2019s waging for the presidency: He\u2019s serving baloney and his supporters can\u2019t get enough of it.\n\nAs bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn\u2019t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical \u201cshow me\u201d readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers\u2014both \"he said and she said\"\u2014and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.\n\nOne reason I admire \"he said/she said\" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the \"she-said\" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the \"she-said\" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I\u2019m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?\n\nI don\u2019t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field\u2014ruling paradigms, if you don\u2019t mind the language\u2014have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report\u2014however seemingly misguided\u2014must be heard.\n\nThe history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a \"she-said\" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.\n\nOr consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology\u2019s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. \u201cYou think, \u2018It\u2019s science; it\u2019s got to be accepted,\u2019\u201d Marshall told Discover magazine. \u201cBut it\u2019s not an absolute given.\u201d By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.\n\nObviously, the critiques of every she-saider don\u2019t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The \u201cone-size, fits all\u201d advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that \u201chomophobia\u201d is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant \u201csuper-predator\u201d thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan\u2019s economy was supposed to overtake the United States\u2019? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.\n\nThe dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody\u2019s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That\u2019s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. \u201cFirst,\u201d Salk writes, they say \u201cthat it can\u2019t be true.\u201d Second phase: \u201cWell, if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not very important.\u201d Third phase: \u201cWell, we\u2019ve known it all along.\u201d\n\nBefore anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don\u2019t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do\u2014but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.\n\nThe last and best reason for supporting \u201che said/she said\u201d journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the \"he said\" side of the story or just the \"she said\" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations\u2014like POLITICO\u2014that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: \u201c[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not getting a steady diet of \"she said\" quotations in your news consumption, you\u2019re at risk of starving to death. \"He said/she said\" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it\u2019s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.\n\n******\n\nA sumptuous meal of news, news, news.

He didn\u2019t go that route.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf Trump\u2019s statement on Obama\u2019s birthplace, Arpaio added: \u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nArpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.\n\nTrump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 a claim the president\u2019s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.\n\nBut while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama\u2019s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that \u201cwe are looking at a forged document. Period.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing \u201cto say it\u2019s a legitimate document.\u201d\n\nArpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president\u2019s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.\n\nStill, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI have no idea now where he was born,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cYou hear a lot of stories.\u201d\n\nHe and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to say it,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Nick Gass", "Madeline Conway", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cIf he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don\u2019t have,\u201d Arpaio said.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cIf he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don\u2019t have,\u201d Arpaio said.", "title": "Joe Arpaio: Trump didn\u2019t call Obama\u2019s birth certificate \u2018legitimate\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2cmSaLc", "image": "http://static.politico.com/99/8a/2a935401461e98ea7561b5b072aa/160921-joe-arpaio-getty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/joe-arpaio-obama-birth-certificate-228487", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/99/8a/2a935401461e98ea7561b5b072aa/160921-joe-arpaio-getty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/1b69811/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F99%2F8a%2F2a935401461e98ea7561b5b072aa%2F160921-joe-arpaio-getty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Joe Arpaio: Trump didn\u2019t call Obama\u2019s birth certificate \u2018legitimate\u2019", "url": "http://politi.co/2cLospd", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474474598000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.\n\n\"It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity.

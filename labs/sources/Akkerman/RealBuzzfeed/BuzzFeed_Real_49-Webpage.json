What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.\u201d\n\nHead of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn\u2019t want moderators correcting lies because \u201cwhat is a big fact, what is a little fact?\u201d #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW \u2014 John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016\n\nThe statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday\u2019s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That\u2019s his strength. He needs it to win.\n\nPolitico recently analyzed Trump\u2019s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.\n\nTrump\u2019s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was \u201csleeping\u201d when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton\u2019s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump\u2019s lying \u201cso greatly exceed[s] Clinton\u2019s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.\u201d Ouch.)\n\nAnd while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (\u201cunemployment rate\u201d), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI\u2019s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn\u2019t need to serve as the \u201cEncyclopedia Britannica,\u201d he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.\n\nJournalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.\n\nIf reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016\n\nDebate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 \u2014 Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016\n\nWhat is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.\n\n@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea\u2026..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. \u2014 Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016\n\nHint: If you find yourself in a political party that\u2019s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.\n\nFeatured image via CNN\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated", "authors": ["Latest

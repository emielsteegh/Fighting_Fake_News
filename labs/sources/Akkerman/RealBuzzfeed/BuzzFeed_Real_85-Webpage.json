There were just five, though he said, \u201cI have quite a few more.\u201d The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, \u201cCarter Page, PhD.\u201d\n\nWho?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump\u2019s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he \u201cwill be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.\u201d\n\nThis piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this guy\u2019s name?\u201d says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.\n\n\u201cI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,\u201d says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. \u201cBut I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, \u2018Have you heard of this guy?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cStrangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,\u201d Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. \u201cIt's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.\u201d\n\nSomeone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who\u2019d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.\n\nThis has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. \u201cI\u2019m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,\" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. \"We want top-of-the-line professionals.\u201d As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn\u2019t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that \u201cHugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.\u201d) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?\n\nEnter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (\u201cI can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?\u2019\u201d says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump\u2019s own campaign.\n\nWhat I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,\u201d says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil giant. \u201cPeople really respect him in this industry. He\u2019s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.\u201d According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials\u2014including Rosneft head Igor Sechin\u2014during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it\u2019s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.\n\nPage has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his \u201cdeep ties\u201d with \u201cexecutives at Gazprom,\u201d the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with \u201cextensive business interests in Russia\u201d and an office \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nPage has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School\u2019s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, \u201cWashington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a \u201cfamous American economist\u201d and \u201cadviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAll of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of \u201cinsiders,\u201d people who seem to be in Trump\u2019s orbit but who may not have\u2014and may never have had\u2014any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.\n\nBut someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate \u201ccorporate investigators\u201d digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won\u2019t say who turned him on to Page\u2019s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin\u2019s chief of staff\u2014both of whom are on the sanctions list\u2014when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.\n\nSo the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?\n\n***\n\nI should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn\u2019t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page\u2019s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.\n\nThis was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.\n\nOK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn\u2019t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nPage\u2019s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. \u201cHe spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,\u201d his bio reads. \u201cHe was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.\u201d\n\nThose were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page\u2019s tenure in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.\n\nSo I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn\u2019t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn\u2019t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch\u2019s purported involvement in the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,\u201d says Craig . \u201cIt closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page\u2019s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, \u201cI rolled my eyes at that one.\u201d (He, too, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Page until Trump\u2019s announcement.)\n\nFine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?\n\nTurns out, they did.\n\n\u201cHis nickname was stranichkin,\u201d from the Russian word stranichka, or \u201clittle page,\u201d says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company\u2019s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. \u201cIt really irritated our team,\u201d Torchinsky told me over Skype. \u201cWe worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we\u2019d have to correct them. These guys didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.\u201d As for Page, \u201cHe made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,\u201d Torchinsky says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.\u201d\n\nOK, harsh. But then I talked to Page\u2019s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t great and he wasn\u2019t terrible,\u201d Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone \u201cwithout any special talents or accomplishments,\u201d someone who was \u201ca gray spot.\u201d \u201cWhat can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?\u201d he asked me.\n\nPage was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was \u201cjust the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\nWhen it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page \u201cwas not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.\u201d When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, \u201cmildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.\u201d And, says Aleksashenko, \u201cjudging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn\u2019t really understand the topic.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, \u201cdid not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\n***\n\nFor the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. \u201cIn recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.\u201d He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and the \u201cartist\u2019s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs\u201d but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (\u201cSlave; Pronunciation: /sl\u0101v/\u2026\u201d), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.\n\nHis speech in Moscow\u2019s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word \u201cironically.\u201d \u201cFor the last 15 years, I\u2019ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,\u201d he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn\u2019t really speak Russian\u2014he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: \u201cWe never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.\u201d Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.\n\nPage also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. \u201cHe had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn\u2019t really want to engage,\u201d one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. \u201cThat blog post about the slaves. That\u2019s just \u2026 strange,\u201d says the Council member.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn\u2019t be in the last decile, but he\u2019d be in the second-to-last decile,\u201d says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. \u201cYou\u2019d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI should\u2019ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign\u2019s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump\u2019s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page\u2019s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.\n\nI was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page\u2019s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia\u2019s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?\n\nBut it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch\u2019s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. \u201cNo one let him into Gazprom,\u201d Aleksashenko says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller\u2019s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.\u201d Another of Page\u2019s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page\u2019s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. \u201cPeople organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cHe hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year\u2026 I used to do this; it doesn\u2019t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re close to him.\u201d\n\nBut the meetings did provide him with something else. \u201cGazprom didn\u2019t need money at the time,\u201d says the former colleague. \u201cThey were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.\u201d Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he\u2019s worked for to invest in them.\n\nAfter Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father\u2019s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as \u201cfounder and managing partner,\u201d even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address\u2014that\u2019s the one \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower\u201d\u2014 which was actually the address of a co-working space.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Carter Page,\u201d says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he\u2019s been trying to throw together these deals. He\u2019s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.\u201d\n\nIn the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this person,\u201d said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page\u2019s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. \u201cI give them money, I don\u2019t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,\u201d he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are engaged in onanism,\u201d said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It\u2019s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAs for the FBI investigation, well, it\u2019s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is \u201cno prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.\u201d He added, \u201cthe story doesn't add up.\u201d What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page\u2019s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, \u201cwhether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.\n\n\u201cHe has no formal role in the campaign,\u201d Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.\n\nNow my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks\u2019s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?\n\nOne way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.\n\nOne source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. \u201cThe only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,\u201d Burt told me. \u201cAnd I told him I\u2019d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I\u2019ve forgotten. He\u2019s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?\u201d\n\nSomeone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump\u2019s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn\u2019t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. \u201cIf he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,\u201d this person told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering your questions,\u201d Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s other spokesperson, says, \u201cCarter Page isn\u2019t someone I\u2019ve interacted with.\u201d Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: \u201cCarter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He\u2019s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWas Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said\u2014he\u2019s my adviser\u2014and what his associates said\u2014\u201cWho?\u201d Maybe I wasn\u2019t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about his Russia fund, other than it\u2019s never really materialized,\u201d says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. \u201cEvery conversation I\u2019ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They\u2019ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.\u201d He went on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t name a project that I could connect Carter\u2019s name to, any project that actually happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s earned a living off this,\u201d the energy player says, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it\u2019s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.\u201d\n\nStrangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, \u201ca lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, \u2018I want to be part of the team,\u2019\u201d says the Trump adviser. And that\u2019s how it happened. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, \u2018He\u2019s an adviser.\u2019 And now he\u2019s milking it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nNow, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington\u2014or at least could plausibly market himself as one. \u201cI was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,\u201d one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there \u201cin a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,\u201d but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen\u2014and be impressed. \u201cHe was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,\u201d the Russia specialist recalls. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.\u201d\n\nAccording to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page\u2019s trip to Russia, \u201cthe meetings did happen and that\u2019s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.\u201d But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. \u201cIt\u2019s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?\u201d said the staffer. \u201cIs he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America\u2019s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It\u2019s what\u2019s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?\u201d\n\nThis seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he\u2019s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is\u2014and to try to turn a profit off of that. \u201cIf Page using his status as \u2018Trump advisor\u2019 for personal gain, that\u2019s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!\u201d Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia\u2019s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy\u2014but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: \u201cCarter Page, Ph.D.\u201d Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.\n\nFor months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin\u2019s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? \u201cI want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,\u201d Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election\u2014as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we\u2019ve finally grasped it.\n\nJulia Ioffe is contributing writer at Politico Magazine.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Julia Ioffe"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Reports of deep Russian ties swirl around Trump adviser Carter Page.

After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama\u2019s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.\n\nThey\u2019re not laughing anymore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGoing into Monday night\u2019s debate, Obama\u2019s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn\u2019t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they\u2019re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they\u2019ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president\u2019s aides \u2013 current and former \u2013 now concede, they\u2019re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re maybe in the fifth season of \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 here. We\u2019re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,\u201d said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.\n\nPrivately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He\u2019s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it\u2019s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who\u2019ve benefited from his policies\u2014like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare\u2014support Democrats.\n\nFor Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump\u2019s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on \u2018hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there\u2019s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.\n\n\u201cWe are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,\u201d said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. \u201cBut we\u2019re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.\n\nAnd the result: Trump\u2019s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama\u2019s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.\n\nThough only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president\u2019s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama\u2019s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks it\u2019s his legacy, I don\u2019t think any of us think it\u2019s his legacy,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. \u201cTrumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.\u201d\n\nBut they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cI think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he\u2019s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. \u201cHe\u2019s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.\u201d\n\nFor any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, \u201cTrump has shattered that,\u201d Vietor said. \u201cHe has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a low blow, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not of substance. That\u2019s a bad lesson for people to learn.\u201d\n\nAccording to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he\u2019d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it\u2019s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.\n\n\u201cHe's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,\u201d said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.\n\nAnd Democrats\u2019 sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that\u2019s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.\n\n\u201cThe eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,\u201d said Earnest, \u201cis intellectually bankrupt\u2014or about something other than the economy.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,\u201d Papa said, \u201cthan have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Edward-isaac Dovere", "Eli Stokols", "Politico Staff", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The president\u2019s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president\u2019s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.", "title": "Obama\u2019s team isn\u2019t laughing at Trump anymore", "url": "http://politi.co/2cW1RDp", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/2122/1155968404_5141376081001_5133513424001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/barack-obama-donald-trump-228649", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/2122/1155968404_5141376081001_5133513424001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Obama\u2019s team isn\u2019t laughing at Trump anymore", "url": "http://politi.co/2cW2vAD", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474866060000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}

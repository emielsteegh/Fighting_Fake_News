I\u2019ve heard it,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThis is his debate tonight, Willie, he\u2019ll tell you if that question is asked. But there\u2019s also \u2014 you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can\u2019t read that plan?\u201d\n\nTrump has vowed to \u201cknock the hell out of ISIS\u201d but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn\u2019t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.\n\nPressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any \u201cknowledge of the landscape,\u201d Conway said, \u201cYes, and he\u2019ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo just to put a button on it, we\u2019ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?\u201d Geist asked.\n\n\u201cYou will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cHe certainly has a plan.

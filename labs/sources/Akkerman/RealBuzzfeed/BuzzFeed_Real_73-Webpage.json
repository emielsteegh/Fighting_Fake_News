Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it\u2019s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.\n\nBiden said:\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who said \u2014 and wants to be president \u2014 that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?\u201d\n\nAdding:\n\n\u201cEvery president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we\u2019re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.\u201d\n\nThen really getting to the core of it, he said:\n\n\u201cHe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don\u2019t take pleasure from \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019 They don\u2019t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.\u201d\n\nBiden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don\u2019t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.\n\n\u201cHe acknowledged that he didn\u2019t pay taxes because, he said, he\u2019s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who\u2019s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.\u201d\n\nBiden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:\n\n\u201cIf this choice isn\u2019t clear, I don\u2019t know \u2013- my lord\u2026 What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true, the choice is abundantly clear \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.\n\nWatch Biden lay into Trump here:\n\nWATCH: VP Biden goes off on Trump over Trump\u2019s comments about not paying taxes: \u201cIt angers me! \u2026 What in the hell is he talking about!?\u201d pic.twitter.com/Qg5L5HcnvL \u2014 NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) September 27, 2016\n\nFeatured image via video screen capture", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Leave it to Biden to say what needs to be said.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Sarah", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Leave it to Biden to say what needs to be said.", "title": "Watch Joe Biden Take Trump\u2019s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/27/watch-joe-biden-take-trumps-own-words-and-tear-him-to-shreds-after-debate-video/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Biden1.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Leave it to Biden to say what needs to be said.", "title": "Watch Joe Biden Take Trump's Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/27/watch-joe-biden-take-trumps-own-words-and-tear-him-to-shreds-after-debate-video/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Biden1.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "angry, debate, Donald Trump, joe biden, middle class, President, Trump, video", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/27/watch-joe-biden-take-trumps-own-words-and-tear-him-to-shreds-after-debate-video/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Biden1.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d427d9653e9e8cd309a5705732c4a54c?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Watch Joe Biden Take Trump\u2019s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.org/2016/09/27/watch-joe-biden-take-trumps-own-words-and-tear-him-to-shreds-after-debate-video/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474934400000}, "source": "http://addictinginfo.org"}

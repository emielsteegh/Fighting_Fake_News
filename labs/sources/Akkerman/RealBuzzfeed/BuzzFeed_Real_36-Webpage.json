Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.\n\nClinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.\n\nBoth candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.\n\nTrump has a slight edge on the question of who is \"honest and trustworthy,\" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who \"shares their values\" and who \"cares about people like them.\" And Clinton beats Trump handily on \"know how to do the job\" and temperament.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["David Wright"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.", "pubdate": "2016-09-23T14:35:30Z", "author": "David Wright, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.", "pubdate": "2016-09-23T14:35:30Z", "title": "National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/mcclatchy-marist-national-poll-before-debate/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160921195724-05-trump-clinton-split-0921-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160921195724-05-trump-clinton-split-0921-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/mcclatchy-marist-national-poll-before-debate/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6  - CNNPolitics", "lastmod": "2016-09-23T16:12:27Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160921195724-05-trump-clinton-split-0921-super-tease.jpg", "description": "Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/mcclatchy-marist-national-poll-before-debate/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160922131045-do-debates-matter-john-king-magic-wall-origwx-js-00005406-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160921195724-05-trump-clinton-split-0921-super-tease.jpg"], "title": "National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6", "url": "http://cnn.it/2cX0uoC", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}

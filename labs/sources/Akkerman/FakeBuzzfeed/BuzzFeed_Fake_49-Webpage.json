In fact, it is one of his life\u2019s purposes to serve and help his \u2018brothers and sisters\u2019 in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.\n\nOn the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith\u2026he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.\n\nHe has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.\n\n\u201cIn terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,\u201d Wilson concluded. \u201cI think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don\u2019t stress out about much.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to\u2026 themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.\n\nGood men\u2019s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.\n\nEspecially now in Obama\u2019s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there\u2026if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share\u2026 corruption can and will take root.\n\nSo the NFL told him not to talk about his faith\u2026\n\nInteresting how things seem so one sided right? Don\u2019t talk about God, it hurts people\u2019s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it\u2019s heroes.\n\nWith this kind of garbage happening\u2026the truth becomes that much more obvious.\n\nWords like \u2018tolerance\u2019 are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.\n\nAsk yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?\n\nThere is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.\n\n\u2026and Obama\u2019s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",

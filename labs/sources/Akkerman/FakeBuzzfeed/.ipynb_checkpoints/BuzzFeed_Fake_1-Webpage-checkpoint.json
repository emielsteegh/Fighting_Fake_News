It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don\u2019t do, to find out the real story \u2013 and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\n\n\u201cIt was natural for people who\u2019ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn\u2019t do anything they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\n\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there\u2019s no evidence they got them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the foundation the media doesn\u2019t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn\u2019t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump\u2019s charitable foundation over concerns that it \u201cengaged in some impropriety\u201d as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others\u2019 contributions \u201cto make them appear to have come from him\u201d although he \u201chasn\u2019t given to the foundation since 2008.\u201d Source: Media Matters\n\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton\u2019s candidacy:\n\nJournalists have been criticized for the \u201cdouble standard\u201d in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton\u2019s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post\u2019s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s Dr. Oz stunt.\n\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton \u201cscandal\u201d (if you call getting sick a \u201cscandal\u201d) while ignoring every scandal in Trump\u2019s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\n\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.", "authors": ["Wendy Gittleson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "These headlines are really damning, unless you actually read beyond them.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Wendy Gittleson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "These headlines are really damning, unless you actually read beyond them.", "title": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These headlines are really damning, unless you actually read beyond them.", "title": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "Bill Clinton, Clinton Foundation, clinton pay to play, Crooked Hillary, Hillary Clinton, political corruption, Trump foundation", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-10.28.21-AM.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7967831c4b263398ad7227f53695cfda?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474243200000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

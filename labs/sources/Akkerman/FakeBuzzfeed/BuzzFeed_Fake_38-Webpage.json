If you do that, we\u2019re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2013 I really mean this, Pennsylvania \u2013 is if cheating goes on.\u201d\n\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to \u201cStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\n\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump\u2019s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images", "authors": ["Stephen D Foster Jr"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Stephen D Foster Jr", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.", "title": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.", "title": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, House Bill 29, Pennsylvania, Republicans, voter intimidation", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/51f1e004223453ced550219e1431c60d?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg"], "title": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474502400000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area\u2026 you know, his culture.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: \u2018Muslims don\u2019t belong here\u2019. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.\n\nFrom April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The lawsuit says that the police had a \u2018reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights of liberty, due process and equal protection\u2019. The Elizabeth police department allegedly \u2019embarked on a course to harass, humiliate, retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm\u2019. The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was \u2018too much crime around here\u2019 and that the area around the restaurant was \u2018known for criminal activity\u2019.\n\nThe irony of it all is that just 5 years later, Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting. Hmmm, it\u2019s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years, right? I\u2019m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it\u2019s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he\u2019s been planning this for some time.", "authors": ["Tiffiny Ruegner"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he\u2019s an entitled whiner.

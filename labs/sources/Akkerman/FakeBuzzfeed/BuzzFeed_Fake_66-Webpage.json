He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to \u201cselective enforcement\u201d based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.\n\nRahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with \u201cbaseless\u201d tickets, and that locals said: \u201cMuslims don\u2019t belong here.\u201d Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.\n\nHe was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["View

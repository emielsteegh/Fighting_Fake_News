One of the most famous is probably \u201cread my lips\u2026no new taxes,\u201d a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:\n\n.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend\u2019s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO \u2014 Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016\n\nTake a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn\u2019t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. \u201cDestroy\u201d doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty \u201cyeeeeehaw,\u201d the reality is that he\u2019s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He\u2019s talking about profiling Muslims. He\u2019s talking about Donald Trump\u2019s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn\u2019t just a Muslim, he\u2019s an\n\nThe man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn\u2019t just a Muslim, he\u2019s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he\u2019s a suspect in a bombing doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked \u201ckill\u201d and not on the most wanted list. There\u2019s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.\n\nWhat that means is that under Trump\u2019s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I\u2019m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn\u2019t about the narrative. It isn\u2019t about prevention or education.\n\nIt\u2019s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.\n\nThe only solace we have is that what he\u2019s promising is nothing but another \u201cread my lips.\u201d Terrorism isn\u2019t something you can simply \u201cdestroy\u201d just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn\u2019t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.\n\nFeatured image from file", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Democrats Winning the Hearts and Minds", "description": "Not only is it unrealistic, it's unconstitutional as hell.", "title": "Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes \u2018Read My Lips\u2019 Look Good", "url": "http://oppositionreport.com/trump-just-made-a-campaign-promise-so-ridiculous-it-makes-read-my-lips-look-good/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-599936028.jpg", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-599936028.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1555147758043521}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-2015-12-18_18-30-53-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1; maximum-scale=1; user-scalable=0;"}, "canonical_link": "http://oppositionreport.com/trump-just-made-a-campaign-promise-so-ridiculous-it-makes-read-my-lips-look-good/", "images": ["http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-599936028.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baio-Fox.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/themes/ares/data/1488260315_logo copy.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-1-6.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-11.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/joe-raedle-houston-flood-getty-OR.jpg"], "title": "Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes \u2018Read My Lips\u2019 Look Good \u2039 Opposition Report", "url": "http://winningdemocrats.com/trump-just-made-a-campaign-promise-so-ridiculous-it-makes-read-my-lips-look-good/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://winningdemocrats.com"}

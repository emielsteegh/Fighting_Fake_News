For real.\n\nThis is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from \u201cintentionally or knowingly touching\u201d the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don\u2019t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.\n\nThe AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that \u201cprosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.\u201d They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?\n\nIn others words, just trust the prosecutors, y\u2019all. There\u2019s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here\u2019s an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority\u2019s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court\u2019s help, Arizona\u2019s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver\u2014out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state\u2019s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona\u2019s parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y\u2019all. Because doesn\u2019t government always know best?", "authors": ["Mockarena Cotr"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court.", "og": {"site_name": "Chicks On The Right", "description": "A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court.", "title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 812, "identifier": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg", "height": 550}, "url": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg", "description": "A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court.", "card": "summary", "title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/", "section": "Constitution", "tag": "felony", "published_time": "2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif", "http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif"], "title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona", "url": "http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474332562000}, "source": "http://www.chicksontheright.com"}

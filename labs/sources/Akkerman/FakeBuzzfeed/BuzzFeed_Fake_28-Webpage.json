The leader, once known as the \u2018Iron Chancellor\u2019, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. \u2018We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,\u2019 she told the conference in Karlsruhe. \u2018With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.\u2019\n\nHere she is, saying that multiculturalism is a \u201cliving lie.\u201d Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it\u2019s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they\u2019re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.\n\nBeware, America. Beware.\n\n(Source: Daily Mail)\n\n\n\n", "authors": ["Elvin Bartley"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.\r\n\r\nThis quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaul", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Elvin Bartley", "og": {"site_name": "Yes I'm Right.", "description": "Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.\r\n\r\nThis quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaul", "title": "Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake", "url": "http://www.yesimright.com/angela-merkel-admits-bringing-in/", "image": "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/merkel.jpg", "updated_time": "2017-08-24T11:29:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.yesimright.com/angela-merkel-admits-bringing-in/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake"}, "fb": {"app_id": 394342743979851}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cropped-favicon2-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/yesiamright/", "section": "POLITICS", "published_time": "2017-08-24T09:21:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-24T11:29:04+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/yesiamright/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.yesimright.com/angela-merkel-admits-bringing-in/", "images": ["http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/obamatreason2_1.jpg", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/merkel.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-4_bCA6jtHeMt5.gif", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/yir_shadow2_long-e1466287423877.png", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hillarydnc-324x160.jpg", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/merkel-696x392.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=EKGFm1akKd60kU", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rosie_1-324x160.jpg", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/msnbcsnap-324x160.jpg", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ANTIFA-8-17-17-324x160.jpg", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/obamaevil_1-324x160.jpg", "http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Woods-5-16-17-324x160.jpg"], "title": "Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake", "url": "https://goo.gl/aKyOlG", "summary": "", "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkQIvgWpIDc?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": {"$date": 1503566460000}, "source": "https://goo.gl"}

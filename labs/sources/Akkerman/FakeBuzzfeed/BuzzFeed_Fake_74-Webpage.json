If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she\u2019s suffering from real cognitive impairment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nKyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.\n\nThese symptoms coupled with Clinton\u2019s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.\n\n\u201cThat paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,\u201d Kyle said, and it\u2019s simply not a good combination for anyone \u2014 much less the president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nKyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton \u2014 and Clinton\u2019s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.\n\nClinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants \u2014 even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.\n\n\u201cShe has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton\u2019s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nThis was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nShare this story and let us know what you think about Dolly Kyle\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton is losing her mental capacities.", "authors":

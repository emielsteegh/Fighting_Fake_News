If the Birther movement is racist\u2026 does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?\n\nWhat if that person is \u2026 Obama?\n\nBreitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled \u201c\u201cKenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate\u201d That was June 2004.\n\nKenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.\n\nIt\u2019s still out there on the internet. Here\u2019s a screen capture:\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.\n\nAnd the link to the original.\n\nThat\u2019s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.\n\nThat was Obama\u2019s publicist. Here\u2019s the quote:\n\nBreitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama\u2019s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as \u201cborn in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.\u201d The booklet, which was distributed to \u201cbusiness colleagues\u201d in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama\u2019s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White\u2013which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.\n\nIf Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?\n\nIf his birth in America is valid \u2014 as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the \u2018foreigner\u2019 card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of \u2026 whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.\n\nBecause if That WASN\u2019T a lie\u2026 then something else MUST be. That \u2018something else\u2019 being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.\n\nThe quote can be read in context at Breitbart.", "authors": ["Rich Witmer", "Doug Giles"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "Clash Daily", "description": "Well THAT'S Weird.

Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s infamous line, \u201cwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u201d the Pope chastised fear-based media.\n\nJournalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of \u201cterrorism\u201d and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of \u201cterrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.\u201d Source: Reuters\n\nNow, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy\u2019s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I\u2019m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that\u2019s what has given us Donald Trump.\n\nCrime in the nation is down. An American\u2019s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:\n\nFear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.

Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they\u2019ve succeeded.\n\nFeatured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images.", "authors": ["Wendy Gittleson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Wendy Gittleson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.", "title": "The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism \u2018Terrorism\u2019", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-503594898.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.", "title": "The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism 'Terrorism'", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-503594898.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "fox fear, politics of fear, pope francis, terrorism fear, trump fear, xenophobia", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-503594898.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7967831c4b263398ad7227f53695cfda?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism \u2018Terrorism\u2019", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474588800000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}

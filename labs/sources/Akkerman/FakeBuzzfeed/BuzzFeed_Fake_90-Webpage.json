Hillary didn\u2019t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!\n\nThe latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear\u2026is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?\n\nTwitter may have figured out the answer\u2026do you see it?\n\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a \u201cCough prevention machine\u201d in her hideous feminist pantsuit?\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nFox News reported that \u201cClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.\u201d\n\nWhile we aren\u2019t sure what was going on inside Hillary\u2019s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, \u201cDid u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?\u201d\n\nWoods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter\u2026\u201cShe can\u2019t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.\u201d\n\nThen Woods added:\n\n\u201cShe literally can\u2019t help herself. She\u2019s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.\u201d\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.\n\nSome claim it\u2019s merely a reflection of studio lights.

I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it\u2019s sort of like either do it or don\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he\u2019s under a lot of pressure,\u201d said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.\n\nYou can see it here:\n\nInstead of hammering Trump for his alleged \u201csupport\u201d for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump\u2019s name.\n\nLuckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.\n\nShare this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you thought of the debate on Monday night.\n\n*USA Politics Today has since pulled their story.", "authors": ["Martin Lioll", "John Falkenberg", "Ben Marquis", "Kimberly J Smith", "Martin Walsh", "V Saxena", "Benjamin Arie"],

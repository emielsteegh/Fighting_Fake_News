According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night\u2019s debate.\n\nBut were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?\n\nAccording to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday\u2019s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz\u2019s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN\u2019s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz\u2019s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn\u2019t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump \u201ctanked\u201d when \u201ctrying to explain why he questioned Obama\u2019s birthplace for so long.\u201d\n\nBut what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.\n\nDrudge poll\u2026 pic.twitter.com/UTCpTmMRbi \u2014 Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) September 27, 2016\n\nAfter Hillary\u2019s tweet that said she won, America shot her down FAST.\n\n@HillaryClinton The number one trending hashtag in the world is #TrumpWon.

But what CNN didn\u2019t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, NBC followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more Democrats than Republicans."}

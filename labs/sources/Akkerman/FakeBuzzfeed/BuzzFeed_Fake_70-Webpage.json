I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.\n\nWhat exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous \u201cfor the first time in my life I\u2019m proud of my country.\u201d I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her \u201c#BringBackOurGirls\u201d sign.\n\nBut why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?\n\n*insert mechanical applause here*\n\nBut what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nI mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?\n\nFor an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her \u201cfaith\u201d and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.\n\nOf course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nBack in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. \u201cI do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a rest-of-my-life horizon.\u201d\n\nThis reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the \u201cI don\u2019t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas\u201d vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.", "authors": ["Sierra Marlee"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

Marines Send TERRORISTS Scathing Message [VIDEO]\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s called terrorism. It\u2019s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.\n\nWhile the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people\u2019s hearts, Marines aren\u2019t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don\u2019t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they\u2019re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists\u2019 faces.\n\nA series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nConsidering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn\u2019t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?\n\nAnd this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they\u2019re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we\u2019re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.\n\nSorry, ISIS. Game over.\n\nShare this on Facebook if you agree with this badass statement!", "authors": ["Cassy Fiano"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "There\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s called terrorism.

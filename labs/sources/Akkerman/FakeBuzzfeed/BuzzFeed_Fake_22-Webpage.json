The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.\n\nAccording to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the \"leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an \u2018Islamic State\u2019 in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nObviously Obama\u2019s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a \u201cJV\u201d team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.\n\nHowever the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.\n\nAnd the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.\n\nHowever what isn\u2019t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.\n\nHere is a link to the Judicial Watch press release detailing the released documents.\n\nHere are the released documents themselves.", "authors": ["Bob Amoroso"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "US Herald", "description": "Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist \u2026", "title": "Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' \u22c6 US Herald", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 876, "identifier": "http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obama-ISIS-Fox.jpg", "height": 493}, "updated_time": "2016-12-09T03:39:55-05:00", "url": "http://usherald.com/breaking-declassified-docs-show-that-obama-admin-created-isis-in-2012-to-use-as-a-tool/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist [\u2026]", "creator": "@usheraldnews", "image": "http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obama-ISIS-Fox.jpg", "title": "Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' \u22c6 US Herald", "site": "@usheraldnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 211561922608080, "pages": 1746057572287188}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/unitedstatesherald/", "section": "- TERROR WATCH -", "published_time": "2015-05-26T09:20:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-12-09T03:39:55-05:00"}, "google-site-verification": "ZdE3006b76rd8x4CyNxQi3cdpRirnUjvfut4ZYX-bqY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://usherald.com/breaking-declassified-docs-show-that-obama-admin-created-isis-in-2012-to-use-as-a-tool/", "images": ["http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/usherald-logo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=718459264928386&ev=PixelInitialized", "http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obama-ISIS-Fox.jpg"], "title": "Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' \u22c6 US Herald", "url": "http://usherald.com/breaking-declassified-docs-show-that-obama-admin-created-isis-in-2012-to-use-as-a-tool?utm_source=aep&utm_medium=obamadeclassifiedisistool&utm_campaign=fbext", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1432650030000}, "source": "http://usherald.com"}

The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company\u2019s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment\u2019s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump\u2019s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. \u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee\u2019s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel\u2019s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he\u2019s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan\u2019s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire\u2019s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP\u2019s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, \u201cEvery American has a unique identity. I\u2019m proud to be gay, I\u2019m proud to be a Republican,\u201d after a lengthy rant against \u201cgovernment incompetence.\u201d He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didn\u2019t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,\u201d said the Department of Labor\u2019s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. \u201cOur nation\u2019s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.\u201d Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer \u2013 the federal government \u2013 of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company\u2019s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

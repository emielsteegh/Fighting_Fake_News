General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief.\n\nAt one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over.\n\nWhen former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren\u2019t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it\u2019s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,\u201d McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.\n\nBarack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.\n\nNot satisfied with accepting McChrystal\u2019s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. \u201cI bet when I die you\u2019ll be happy to pee on my grave.\u201d The General saluted. \u201cMr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I\u2019d never stand in line again.\n\nGood job General McChrystal. I\u2019m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won\u2019t have to stand in line. You\u2019re an honorable man, we know you wouldn\u2019t cut in front of others.\n\n906", "authors": ["Scott Osborn", "Mr Wendal"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "I Have The Truth", "description": "This is a true story.\u00a0 General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief.

{"title": "Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT", "text": "Once again, the \u201creligion of peace\u201d has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant \u2014 but don\u2019t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn\u2019t listen anyway.\r\n\r\nIn May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly \u201chomophobic\u201d attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,\u201d Sussex police reported.\r\n\r\nAccording to the victim\u2019s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant \u201cwas shouting all this Muslim stuff \u2026 Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"Gay-Bashing\" Incident\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a gentle giant. He\u2019s the kindest person you could imagine \u2014 this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,\u201d Markintosh added.\r\n\r\nNear the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,\u201d Sgt. Peter Allan said. \u201cI am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their \u201creligion of peace,\u201d right?\r\n\r\nWrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.\r\n\r\nMany American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society\u2019s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot \u201cco-exist\u201d \u2014 which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow."}

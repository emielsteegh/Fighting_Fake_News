He\u2019s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers\u201d from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d He\u2019s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:\n\n\u201cThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don\u2019t kid yourself. When they say they don\u2019t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald\u2019s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism \u2014 he\u2019s fighting the \u201cnarratives\u201d of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d is \u201ckill them all\u201d:\n\nLast weekend\u2019s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama\u2019s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we\u2019re in more than a fight about \u2018narratives\u2019 \u2013 these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nPay attention to that last bit: \u201cThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\u201d\n\nNow, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating \u201cterrorists?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protecting each other, but they\u2019re really doing very bad damage \u2014 they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,\u201d Trump said in March. \u201cWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nIf Muslims are \u201cprotecting\u201d terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump\u2019s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists\u2019 families. How would he define terrorism?\n\nThese are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself \u2014 but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents\u2019 security to \u201csee what happens\u201d to them (shortly after suggesting that \u201cSecond Amendment People\u201d could deal with them. We\u2019re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the \u2018little red button\u2019 that launches our nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen \u2014 one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.\n\nNormally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He\u2019s said it himself. Many times.\n\nIf we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation \u2014 to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it\u2019s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.\n\nFeatured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle", "authors": ["John Prager"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "If Trump becomes President, this will not end well.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "John Prager", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "If Trump becomes President, this will not end well.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Trump becomes President, this will not end well.", "creator": "@EvilLiberalPig", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg", "title": "Trump's Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/iamyourknight"}, "keywords": "Adolf Hitler, Barack Obama, concentration camps, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Trump, trump 2016", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/896e3249030ff74276709a1914c25ea3?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump\u2019s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474243200000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

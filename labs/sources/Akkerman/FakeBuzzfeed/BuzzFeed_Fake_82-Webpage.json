Obama Spends $770M Dollars In Tax Payer Money To Renovate Mosques Over Seas\u2026 [VIDEO]\n\nCBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he\u2019s still doing it. He\u2019s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran\u2026 why he gives ISIS a pass\u2026 why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.\n\nSet aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office\u2026 it\u2019s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques\u2026 we are funding their wars as well, even against America.\n\nFrom TruthFeed:\n\n\u201cYou Didn\u2019t Build That\u201d\u2026Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas \u2014 outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States \u2018investment\u2019 of millions to refurbish mosques as a \u2018good-will effort\u2019 in Muslim countries has upset many. \u201cWe are spending money we don\u2019t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,\u201d said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.\n\nMany of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can\u2019t make ends meet and our country can\u2019t pay its bills\u2026 yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.\n\nThe State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas \u2013 something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: \u201cFighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.\u201d What bovine excrement.\n\nLet me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic. This is a coup from without and from within\u2026 the enemy is now among us.", "authors": ["Terresa Monroe-hamilton"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015.

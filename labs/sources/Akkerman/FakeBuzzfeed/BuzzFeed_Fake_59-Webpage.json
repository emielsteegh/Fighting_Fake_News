The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.\n\nThe #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon \u2013 thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016\n\nWhat\u2019s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from \u2013 which will come as quite a surprise:\n\nData is from Trendsmap.com\n\nThat\u2019s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin\u2019s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It\u2019s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin\u2019s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.\n\nPutin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: \u201chumourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.\u201d\n\nSo remember \u2013 don\u2019t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

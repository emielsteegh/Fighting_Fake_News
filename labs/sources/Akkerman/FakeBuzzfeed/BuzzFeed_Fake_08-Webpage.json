{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-clinton-1.jpg", "text": "I can\u2019t wait for \u201cWeekend at Chelsea\u2019s\u201d to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton\u2019s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups \u2013 these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low \u2013 would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a \u201cminor setback\u201d to her \u201cinevitable\u201d victory.\n\nThe American people aren\u2019t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d dismissals. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cmild cold,\u201d er, \u201cseasonal allergies,\u201d I mean \u201cheat exhaustion,\u201d that is to say \u201cminor case of pneumonia\u201d is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a \u201cmystery man\u201d who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable \u201cepisodes\u201d (or otherwise freezes up with a brain \u201cshort-circuit\u201d during a speech).\n\nThis guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.\n\nBlue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has \u201cpneumonia\u201d required a neurological squeeze test?).\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won\u2019t, but they should. I wonder what official \u201cdiagnosis\u201d we\u2019ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they\u2019ve been there a hundred times before. \u201cNothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton\u2019s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she \u2018powered through\u2019 yesterday going door-to-door.\u201d\n\nThe point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She\u2019s proven, yet again, that she can\u2019t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She\u2019s a liar. That\u2019s her default mode. She\u2019s corrupt. And she\u2019s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else \u2013 including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.\n\nDo I take joy in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. \u201cDo not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice\u201d (Proverbs 24:17).\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d has only served to accelerate the plunge.\n\nPerhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement \u2013 especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her \u201cfriend and mentor.\u201d Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags \u2013 the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.\n\nWho\u2019s the racist?\n\nI\u2019m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can\u2019t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.\n\nIt\u2019s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she\u2019s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she\u2019s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, \u201cMany are the plans in a person\u2019s heart, but it is the LORD\u2019s purpose that prevails.\u201d\n\nAm I saying there\u2019s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there\u2019s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.\n\nStill, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton\u2019s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector \u2013 a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.\n\nWhen they visit her in prison.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Matt Barber"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Am I saying there\u2019s no chance Hillary Clinton will win?

Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary\u2019s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey\u2019s fate.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. \u201cThis now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director\u2019s fitness for office,\u201d DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills\u2019 computer. \u201cThe contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was not a real investigation. This was a \u2018protected investigation\u2019 designed to look like an investigation.\u201d\n\nDiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nWill Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn\u2019t just having to face a hearing; he\u2019s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.\n\nCongress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton\u2019s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.\n\nHow loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? And if the answer to that question is \u201cyes,\u201d then the new question becomes\u2026 why?", "authors": ["Cassy Fiano"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism\u2026 and it looks like", "title": "BREAKING: Steps to FORCE FBI Director Comey to Resign In Process - Hearing Decides His Fate Sept 28 | John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/6-1-1.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2016-09-27T15:54:33-04:00", "url": "http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/breaking-steps-force-fbi-director-comey-resign-process-hearing-decides-fate-sept-28/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "robots": "noimageindex", "fb": {"app_id": 1631890973779575, "pages": 389658314427637}, "article": {"section": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2016-09-26T12:35:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-09-27T15:54:33-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/breaking-steps-force-fbi-director-comey-resign-process-hearing-decides-fate-sept-28/", "images": ["http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/comey-e1427479928279.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg", "http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/6-1-1-890x395_c.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/6-1-1.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/james-comey-e1473955052391.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg", "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg"], "title": "BREAKING: Steps to FORCE FBI Director Comey to Resign In Process \u2013 Hearing Decides His Fate Sept 28", "url": "http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/breaking-steps-force-fbi-director-comey-resign-process-hearing-decides-fate-sept-28/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474907754000}, "source": "http://rightwingnews.com"}

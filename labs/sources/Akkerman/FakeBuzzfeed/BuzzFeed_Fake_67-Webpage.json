This is just tone deaf to the nth power.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that if you\u2019re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\n\nWhile you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.\n\nSurely you\u2019d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nWell apparently your President doesn\u2019t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.\n\nAre you outraged yet?\n\nIt gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the \u201csexism\u201d he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I\u2019ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is going down the tubes.\n\nHe bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.\n\nCritics will say that he didn\u2019t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don\u2019t have to know every single detail to say \u201can explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.\u201d And then move on to the business of the hour.\n\nBut no, he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to do that.

That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.\n\nDonald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He\u2019s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He\u2019s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He\u2019s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to \u201crelax\u201d he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he\u2019s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he\u2019s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump\u2019s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it\u2019s just gibberish:\n\nFive people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016\n\nJust\u2026what is he talking about? If you\u2019re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.\n\nTalking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He\u2019s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.\n\nFeatured image from file", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Democrats Winning the Hearts and Minds", "description": "Things aren't looking good here.", "title": "Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End\u2013May Be Unfit For Debate", "url": "http://oppositionreport.com/donald-trump-goes-off-the-deep-end-may-be-unfit-for-debate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpPins-Twitter.jpg", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpPins-Twitter.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1555147758043521}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-2015-12-18_18-30-53-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1; maximum-scale=1; user-scalable=0;"}, "canonical_link": "http://oppositionreport.com/donald-trump-goes-off-the-deep-end-may-be-unfit-for-debate/", "images": ["http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baio-Fox.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/themes/ares/data/1488260315_logo copy.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-1-6.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-11.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpPins-Twitter.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/joe-raedle-houston-flood-getty-OR.jpg"], "title": "Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End\u2013May Be Unfit For Debate \u2039 Opposition Report", "url": "http://winningdemocrats.com/donald-trump-goes-off-the-deep-end-may-be-unfit-for-debate/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://winningdemocrats.com"}

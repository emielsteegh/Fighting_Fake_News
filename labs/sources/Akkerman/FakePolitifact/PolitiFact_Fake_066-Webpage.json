According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyan\u2019s office has asserted that he can not be \u201cfired\u201d by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump\u2019s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.\n\nRelate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn\u2019t say things he doesn\u2019t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker\u2026You\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that.", "authors": ["About Stryker", "Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can't Stand The Lazy Cryba Fantasy World Liberals Live In Knowledge Is Power The Truth Will Set You Free May The Good Lord Bless Keep The United States Of America"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Americas Last Line of Defense", "description": "POTUS walked right up to Ryan at a luncheon and let him know he was finished.", "title": "BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan \u2018You\u2019re Fired\u2019", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eagle-flag.jpg?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-14T18:19:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-14T18:19:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/", "images": ["http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-llod-site-header-2.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gaga.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/83.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/odonnell2.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/patriotic-pets1.jpg?resize=669%2C405", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/87.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/85.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/82.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1money.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/80.jpg?resize=326%2C245"], "title": "President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan \u2018You\u2019re Fired\u2019 \u2013 Americas Last Line of Defense", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1489515548000}, "source": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org"}

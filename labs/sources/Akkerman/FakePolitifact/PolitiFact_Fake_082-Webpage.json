According to the testimony of several witnesses, Darren Winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n\n\u201cDarren\u2019s a recreational diver,\u201d commented one of the injured man\u2019s friends. \u201cFor some time, he\u2019s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he\u2019d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\u201d\n\nMr Winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence, an apartment in Ybor, telling them he\u2019d finally perfected what he called his \u2018scuba bong\u2019. \u201cClearly it wasn\u2019t a bong at all,\u201d pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists, \u201cbut he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him.\u201d\n\nWhen his friends assembled at Mr Winter\u2019s residence, they found him heavily intoxicated. \u201cHe\u2019d had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived, as he was so delighted to finally have his \u2018scuba bong\u2019 up and running.\u201d With his friends present, Mr Winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the home-made device in action. This is the point that everything went horribly wrong.\n\nAccording to the witnesses, Mr Winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled, knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor. \u201cThe tank basically exploded after [Winters] knocked it over,\u201d commented one of the witnesses. None of Winter\u2019s friends were injured, but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body.\n\nWinter\u2019s friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital, where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds. His condition has now been downgraded from \u2018critical\u2019 to \u2018serious\u2019, but medical staff announced they\u2019d been unable to save his testicles which had been \u2018cleanly severed\u2019 by a shard of metal.\n\nPreliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by Winters may be banned from dive use throughout the US. \u201cThis tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing,\u201d commented the lead investigator on the case. \u201cWe regularly audit dive shops in Tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold; however, the ban only extends to using the tank when diving. If [Winters] purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis, the retailer has technically not breached the law.\u201d\n\nThis news will be little comfort to Mr Winters, who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank. The young man faces a long recovery, but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the toughest guys I know,\u201d commented one of Mr Winter\u2019s friends. \u201cHe\u2019ll take the fact he won\u2019t be able to have kids pretty hard, though.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed. Mr Winters is actually employed on a part-time basis at a Tampa pizza restaurant. We regret the error.\n\nIn other news making headlines, a 68-year old man from Decatur in Northern Alabama has discovered that his new bride is actually his own grand-daughter.

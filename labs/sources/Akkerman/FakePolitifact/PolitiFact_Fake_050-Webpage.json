{"title": "Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible", "text": "The White House has approved the redesign of U.S. currency.  Barack Obama will be on the new dollar bill.\r\n\r\nThe Obama Administration feels that the American dollar is in bad need of a makeover.  They have partnered with the Dollar ReDe$ign Project to pick a new design for U.S. currency.  Currently, the design that the administration likes best was done by Dowling Duncan (a British duo), which features a unique vertical design.  It also features President Obama on the one dollar bill.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe love the Dowling Duncan look.  They\u2019ve come up with a creative design and put President Obama where he belongs\u2026 on number 1,\u201d said David Axelrod, Senior Adviser to President Obama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dollar Redesign Project was organized by creative strategy consultant Richard Smith.  He is still soliciting ideas for the dollar bill of the future. \u201cOur great \u2018rival\u2019, the Euro, looks so spanky in comparison it seems the only clear way to revive this global recession is to rebrand and redesign,\u201d the project notes on its website.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the web site for  The Dollar Redesign Project.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time submitting a design, it\u2019s a done deal,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff.  The President wants \u201cchange\u201d in the currency and we\u2019ve unanimously picked Dowling Duncan\u2019s work.  Fed Chairman, Benjamin Bernanke, has signed off on our choice for the redesign.  We intend to have the money in circulation by December, 2012.\u201d\r\n\r\nEmanuel went on to say that there are plans to redo U.S. coins as well.  \u201cWe don\u2019t need a complete redesign of our coins, but we do want to put President Obama on the penny and move President Lincoln to the nickel. Thomas Jefferson, who was on the nickel, will be\u2026 discontinued.\u201d  Republican  Congressman Paul Ryan suggested President Obama be  put on both the \u201cnickel and dime\u201d instead of the penny.\r\n\r\nAnother American icon might also be replaced.  \u201cUncle Sam is outdated,\u201d said Axelrod.  \u201cWe need to update this icon as well.  It will now be Uncle Barack.\u201d\r\n\r\nRepublicans are apoplectic about the changes the Administration is proposing.  \u201cThey won\u2019t get this passed when we get control of the house,\u201d said Minority Leader John Boehner.  \u201cTypical Republicans, they want to block everything, even a little meaningless design issue,\u201d said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they think, we\u2019re going to pass this and every American will be carrying Obama dollars in their wallets and purses come December, 2012.\u201d\r\n\r\nFYI:  The Obama dollar will reportedly be worth $0.47."}

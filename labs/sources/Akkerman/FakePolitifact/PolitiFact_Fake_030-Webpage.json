Namely, Michelle Obama\u2019s mom failed to earn a pension that\u2019s three times the amount of an average American family\u2019s whole income!\r\n\r\nIt appears to be that just as Barack, the rest of the Obama\u2019s never intended on getting jobs as us, the regular folks, because they got the chance to live on the backs of honest and hard working Americans that pay taxes.\r\n\r\nCongress just announced the most stupid, unexplained and unethical waste of taxpayer money prepared by no other than Obama.\r\n\r\nFirst Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will get a big fat check for a lifetime worth 160K government pension when she takes off the White House next year, as concluded by congressional budget statements.\r\nAs concluded in documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson got to be eligible for the lifetime pension for \u201cservices rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver\u201d for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama\u2019s eight years in office.\r\n\r\nMichelle Obama\u2019s mom got to live better than a royalty in the White House, but they are still going to privilege her with $160,000 every year for the rest of her life just for being there her own granddaughters?\r\n\r\nHow pathetic excuse is that?"}

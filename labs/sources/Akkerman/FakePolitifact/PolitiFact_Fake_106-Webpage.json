Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.\n\nHere is what Chaffetz said:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Here\u2019s what he said: \u2018You do a great job. Listen, I understand I\u2019m the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Don\u2019t slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.\u2019 If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of \u2018don\u2019t slow down,\u2019 I think was a good message.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.\n\nWithout Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. It\u2019s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she won\u2019t make it out of this investigation so easily.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

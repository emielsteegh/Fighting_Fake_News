{"title": "Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don\u2019t Dump Trump", "text": "During a time when the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, should be working to bring the party together and prepare for the primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he continues to deepen the divide between Republicans and Americans alike.\r\n\r\nTrump\u2019s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.\r\n\r\nGraham claimed that Trump\u2019s racist remarks were \u201cthe most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\u201d Graham told The New York Times.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News\u2019 Hallie Jackson.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019ll come a point in time where we\u2019re gonna have to understand that it\u2019s not just about the 2016 race, it\u2019s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nDonald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree more with a statement like that,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose kinds of comments are very serious to me,\u201d Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. \u201cThey are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate \u2014 which is why I think this is so serious \u2014 is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned Trump\u2019s accusations, they continue to support him."}

I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.\n\nSo then the one guy finds out that I\u2019m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Sure, what the hell.\u2019 So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rockford \u2013 some place on State Street, I think \u2013 and got a burger. Great freakin\u2019 burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.\n\nI\u2019m telling you, these people in Rockford are the real deal. I\u2019m going to move there after I retire,\u201d Diesel said with a laugh.\n\nDiesel added later, \u201cYou have to understand, this is something that would\u2019ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that\u2019s my story about Rockford, Illinois. It\u2019s nice to know there are still places like this in America.\u201d\n\nphoto by Gage Skidmore / CC BY-SA 3.0 / cropped\n\nShare this on Facebook: Facebook", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "WBN 12 News", "description": "ROCKFORD, Illinois - During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were just leaving the city limits of Rockford, Ill", "title": "Vin Diesel Had This to Say About the Residents of Rockford, Illinois", "locale": "en", "image": "http://wbn12.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vin_Diesel.jpg", "updated_time": "2017-07-12T02:38:42+00:00", "url": "http://wbn12.com/rockford-illinois/vin-diesel-had-this-to-say-about-the-residents-of-rockford-illinois/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Rockford Illinois", "published_time": "2017-03-12T04:24:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-12T02:38:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://wbn12.com/rockford-illinois/vin-diesel-had-this-to-say-about-the-residents-of-rockford-illinois/", "image": "http://wbn12.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vin_Diesel.jpg", "description": "ROCKFORD, Illinois - During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were just leaving the city limits of Rockford, Ill", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Vin Diesel Had This to Say About the Residents of Rockford, Illinois"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://wbn12.com/rockford-illinois/vin-diesel-had-this-to-say-about-the-residents-of-rockford-illinois/", "images": ["http://wbn12.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-plus/images/simple-share-buttons-logo-white.png", "http://wbn12.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vin_Diesel-777x437.jpg", "http://wbn12.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vin_Diesel.jpg"], "title": "Vin Diesel Had This to Say About the Residents of Rockford, Illinois \u2013 WBN 12 News", "url": "http://wbn12.com/rockford-illinois/vin-diesel-had-this-to-say-about-the-residents-of-rockford-illinois/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1489292677000}, "source": "http://wbn12.com"}

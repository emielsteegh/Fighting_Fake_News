Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.\n\nTrump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama\u2019s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:\n\n\u201cThe proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can\u2019t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.\u201d\n\nThe call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama\u2019s phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will be pardoning him anytime soon.", "authors": ["About Stryker", "Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can't Stand The Lazy Cryba Fantasy World Liberals Live In Knowledge Is Power The Truth Will Set You Free May The Good Lord Bless Keep The United States Of America"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Americas Last Line of Defense", "description": "Obama may have just bitten off more than he can chew.", "title": "BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama\u2019s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eagle-flag.jpg?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-04T15:04:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-04T15:04:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/", "images": ["http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-llod-site-header-2.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/83.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/87.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/85.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/82.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/80.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/radioalice.cbslocal.com20100704patriotic-pets-happy-birthday-usa.jpg?resize=500%2C375"], "title": "FBI Issues Warrant For Obama\u2019s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap \u2013 Americas Last Line of Defense", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1488639875000}, "source": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org"}

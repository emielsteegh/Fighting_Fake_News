{"title": "BREAKING Clinton Foundation Ordered To Cease Operations \u2013 Chelsea Charged With Fraud", "text": "As we know, Clinton Foundation has been given an A+ as a charitable organization. It slightly made more reputable than the Red Cross. Now, it has been ordered to cease operations. Chelsea Clinton, the CEO, has been charged with fraud and a warrant issued for her arrest. But, following this news, Clintons were nowhere to be found for an interview.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the shutdown is the alleged \u2018\u2019pay for play\u2019\u2019 donations that saw rich and powerful terrorists gain access to Washington DC in exchange for cash. During Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State, it\u2019s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with Obama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. Then, the creator of ISIS, Osama Bin Laden was sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death.\r\n\r\nSo, it all comes down to how Chelsea Clinton used her family foundation\u2019s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents. Doug Band, formerly a top aide to President Bill Clinton, griped about the former first daughter\u2019s spending in a Jan.4, 2012, email released by WikiLeaks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents\u2026,\u201d Band wrote to John Podesta, now Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope that you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nA chain of emails was hacked from Podesta\u2019s Gmail account and WikiLeaks has released more that 50,000 of the stolen emails over the past 32 days."}

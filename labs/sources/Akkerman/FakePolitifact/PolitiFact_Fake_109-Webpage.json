The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for \u201cspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior\u201d \u2013 which she said had \u201cshaken (her) to the core.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Pence argued, \u201cI have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That\u2019s the first thing I don\u2019t quite get. Secondly, if she\u2019s the First Lady, shouldn\u2019t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What\u2019s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That\u2019s not what she should be doing.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Indiana also said that she \u201chas no business\u201d commenting on men and their \u201crestroom talk,\u201d as well as that that\u2019s not \u201cladylike behavior.\u201d \u201cNow, I know that the word \u2018lady\u2019 is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she\u2019s not behaving like one, at least as of late,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she was a real lady, she wouldn\u2019t be commenting on men\u2019s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn\u2019t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she\u2019s not only being vocal about it, but she\u2019s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can\u2019t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can\u2019t fool me, just like she can\u2019t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cHe has apologized for it several times, and I really don\u2019t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the first lady also thinks she\u2019s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn\u2019t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I\u2019m actually glad that\u2019s the case because when Donald wins, we\u2019ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,\u201d Pence concluded.", "authors": ["Alex Stevan"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news", "generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Newslo", "description": "\u201cThis is too well organized to be an accident.

Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn\u2019t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff. Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didn\u2019t get the part.\n\nNow the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.\n\nMeryl Streep, who hasn\u2019t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement. The date for that has been moved up now that she\u2019s been deemed overrated by Trump and irrelevant to most Trump supporters, which basically covers the known world and the leader of it.\n\nRELATED:\n\nDonald Trump Just Coined A New Phrase You\u2019re Going To Love\n\nIf we learned anything from Meryl Streep\u2019s long-winded, elitist rant, it\u2019s that we shouldn\u2019t try to bother understanding vocabulary that\u2019s over our heads. We sure don\u2019t want to be bothered watching a six-minute video when there\u2019s 1 and 2-minute videos of hot blondes on Fox telling us the stuff we want to hear.\n\nThat\u2019s why libtards have to live their lie. Because the beautiful women of the smartest network on TV make them jealous.", "authors": ["About Stryker", "Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can't Stand The Lazy Cryba Fantasy World Liberals Live In Knowledge Is Power The Truth Will Set You Free May The Good Lord Bless Keep The United States Of America"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Americas Last Line of Defense", "description": "Sources say without it, the aging ex-star may go broke.", "title": "BREAKING: Meryl Streep Just Got Fired From A Major Project For Lying About Trump", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-meryl-streep-just-got-fired-from-a-major-project-for-lying-about-trump/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/streep.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/streep.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eagle-flag.jpg?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"published_time": "2017-01-09T19:10:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-01-09T19:10:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-meryl-streep-just-got-fired-from-a-major-project-for-lying-about-trump/", "images": ["http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-llod-site-header-2.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/83.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/streep.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/patriotic-pets1.jpg?resize=669%2C405", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/streep.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/87.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/85.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gummercover.jpg?resize=338%2C225", "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/82.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/80.jpg?resize=326%2C245"], "title": "Meryl Streep Just Got Fired From A Major Project For Lying About Trump \u2013 Americas Last Line of Defense", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-meryl-streep-just-got-fired-from-a-major-project-for-lying-about-trump/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1483989030000}, "source": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org"}

While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\n\nDetails are still coming out, but apparently Nugent often hunts this are for animals that stray from the preserve. He was just setting up before dawn without any reflective or hunter\u2019s orange visible, wearing a fur hat he would typically change for a camo and orange version once the sun came up.\n\nThe hunter who shot him faces manslaughter charges as the shot rang out and was recorded by a local game warden a full 15 minutes before dawn, which is the legal start of the day for hunting. The identity of the hunter hasn\u2019t been released. He was arrested and booked at the State Police barracks in Boseman. Nugent\u2019s family has been notified.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nPlease send your thoughts and prayers to Ted\u2019s family and friends in this trying time.", "authors": ["About Stryker", "Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can't Stand The Lazy Cryba Fantasy World Liberals Live In Knowledge Is Power The Truth Will Set You Free May The Good Lord Bless Keep The United States Of America"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Americas Last Line of Defense", "description": "The conservative world just lost a great man.", "title": "BREAKING: Conservative Icon Ted Nugent Killed In Hunting Accident", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/ted-nugent-shot-dead-hunting/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/klu.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/klu.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eagle-flag.jpg?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-28T11:33:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-29T04:04:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/ted-nugent-shot-dead-hunting/", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/klu.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-llod-site-header-2.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/83.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/87.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/85.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/klu.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/82.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/80.jpg?resize=326%2C245"], "title": "Conservative Icon Ted Nugent Killed In Hunting Accident \u2013 Americas Last Line of Defense", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/ted-nugent-shot-dead-hunting/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1493379209000}, "source": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org"}

In an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d the \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I\u2019m not free anymore,\u201d Gaga said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody\u2019s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can\u2019t even call the police to help me because they\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d the singer complained. \u201cI realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I\u2019d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off \u2013 we\u2019ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.\u201d\n\nAsked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn\u2019t her \u201cfirst choice,\u201d as well as that \u201che couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,\u201d due to the fact that \u201cI might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.\u201d \u201cIt was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven\u2019t been able to do that in a long time,\u201d she revealed.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I\u2019m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,\u201d the singer revealed. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that\u2019ll cover my face, but what I do know is that\u2019s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I\u2019m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody\u2019s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I\u2019m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I\u2019ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say \u2013 I guess I\u2019ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,\u201d Gaga concluded.\n\nvia: therightists.com\n\nLady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again \u201cUntil Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More\u201d", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m very acutely aware that once I cross that property...", "generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Spinzon", "description": "Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame.

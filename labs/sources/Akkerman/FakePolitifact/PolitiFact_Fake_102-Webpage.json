Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.\n\nSpeaking to our intern Dave Robicheaux, who is paid in Facebook likes, Trump insisted Col. Harland Sanders, whom he called a \u201ctremendous Civil War hero,\u201d once saved an entire army at Valley Forge from certain starvation. Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.\n\nRobicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.\n\nUpon being confronted with these facts, The Donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a Confederate monument removal protest in New Orleans while screaming about fake news.\n\nChurch\u2019s Chicken and Popeye\u2019s Louisiana Kitchen were unavailable for comment.\n\nIncidentally, Trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies\u2019 restaurants if they don\u2019t share their respective secret recipes with him.\n\nThe Red Shtick will update this story as new attacks from the White House on history and our deep-fried way of life develop.\n\nWhat Do You Think Of This Shtick?", "authors": ["Manny Schewitz Is A Progressive Liberal The Dirty South With A Thirst For The Truth Humor Whiskey He

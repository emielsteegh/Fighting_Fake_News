Two United States Representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of President Trump. These aren\u2019t some off-the-hook left wing extremists, they\u2019re typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.\n\nRep. Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.\n\nAccording to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men\u2019s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. It\u2019s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:\n\n\u201cTheir plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a \u2018design for a new video game,\u2019\u201d said Special Agent George Ketterman, \u201cWhile they never actually used the president\u2019s name or purchased any of the items listed in the \u2018game,\u2019 like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.\u201d\n\nIn unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.\n\nNBC News tried to reach out to the men\u2019s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn\u2019t find one. It would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the Patriot Act.\n\nWelcome to Trump\u2019s America, liberals. If you step out of line you\u2019ll be removed altogether.", "authors": ["Thomas Rhett"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"ca_image": "http://proudleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/25602642832_4ae1e69452_b-150x150.jpg", "generator": "WordPress 4.7.5", "og": {"site_name": "Proud Leader", "description": "Need more proof that liberalism is a disease?

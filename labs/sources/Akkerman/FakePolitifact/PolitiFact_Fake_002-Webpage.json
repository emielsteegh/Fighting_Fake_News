Jos\u00e9 Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company\u2019s Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270\u00b0 during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.\r\n\r\nThe company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.\r\n\r\nRodriguez, 63, of Riverside and Florez, 42, of Whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. \u201cWe remain devastated by the loss of her colleague Jos\u00e9 Melena in the tragic accident,\u201d company said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with and are disappointed by the charges filed by the Los Angeles Dist. Atty.\u2019s office.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the Associated Press, Florez refused to comment and messages seeking comment from Rodriguez were not immediately returned."}

While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the \u2018white question\u2019 will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.\n\nThankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.\u201d\n\nThe blog post was removed from Zakaria\u2019s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.\n\nCNN officials have refused to take action against their employee, stating that there was no evidence of hate speech or racism in Zakaria\u2019s writings because he only targeted whites and not minorities. \u201cSome people are just being too sensitive,\u201d a CNN representative said in defense of Zakaria, adding that \u201csomeone\u2019s hurt feelings should not inhibit our right to free speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,\u201d Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.\n\nWhile many have indeed expressed emotional pain and fear after reading his controversial statements, no apology has been heard from Zakaria or CNN at the time of this writing.\n\nsource: redherald", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"ca_image": "http://teoinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fareed-Zakaria-150x150.jpg", "generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "robots": "noindex,follow", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://teoinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-images-1-270x270.jpg", "ca_title": "CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://teoinfo.com/2017/06/30/cnn-host-fareed-zakaria-calls-for-jihad-rape-of-white-women/", "images": ["http://teoinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fareed-Zakaria-800x445.jpg"], "title": "CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women \u2013 TEO info", "url": "http://teoinfo.com/2017/06/30/cnn-host-fareed-zakaria-calls-for-jihad-rape-of-white-women/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1498780800000}, "source": "http://teoinfo.com"}

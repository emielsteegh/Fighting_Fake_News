Don\u2019t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that \u201cat one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don\u2019t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who\u2019s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google \u2018the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?\u2019 I mean, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what worried me even more,\u201d she continued, \u201cwas the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I\u2019m sitting there, thinking, \u2018Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn\u2019t paying attention during history class \u2013 a lot of someones, apparently \u2013 hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarlson also added, \u201cI mean, I know the education in our country isn\u2019t the best in the world, but I figured we\u2019d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What\u2019s the next thing I\u2019m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I\u2019m not buying it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don\u2019t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don\u2019t believe how stupid Americans can be,\u201d she said.\n\n31.4k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Red Herald", "description": "Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15.

This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal \u201cBlack Empowerment\u201d program.\n\nFor years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom\u2019s middle managers are 30% white and it\u2019s skilled labor force is 21% white.\n\nThe South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it\u2019s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.\n\nEskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.\n\nSouth Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it\u2019s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.\n\nSource (South Africa Channel 24)\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\n", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "SA power company ordered to fire 3,389 whites, as roving blackouts sweep the nation", "generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Conservative Headlines", "description": "SA power company ordered to fire 3,389 whites, as roving blackouts sweep the nation", "title": "South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees", "url": "http://conservative-headlines.com/2015/03/south-african-firm-ordered-to-lay-off-3389-white-employees/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=600%2C315", "height": 315}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=600%2C315&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 577223705644733}, "keywords": "south africa", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T21:48:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T21:48:03+00:00"}}, "canonical_link": "http://conservative-headlines.com/2015/03/south-african-firm-ordered-to-lay-off-3389-white-employees/", "images": ["http://conservative-headlines.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png", "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=500%2C263", "https://i1.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/confederate-flags2.jpg"], "title": "South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees", "url": "http://conservative-headlines.com/2015/03/south-african-firm-ordered-to-lay-off-3389-white-employees/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1425937683000}, "source": "http://conservative-headlines.com"}

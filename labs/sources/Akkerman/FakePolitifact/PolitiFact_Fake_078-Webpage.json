If you doubt that Donald Trump is God\u2019s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he\u2019s not. And we know that he\u2019s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. That\u2019s not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We don\u2019t choose them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they\u2019ve been chosen and know that that\u2019s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children\u2019s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.\n\nEvangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert\u2019s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:\n\n\u201cIf Christians don\u2019t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.\u201d\n\nCopeland appeared on Colbert\u2019s \u201cPray for America\u201d call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "ALTERNATIVE MEDIA SYNDICATE", "description": "Donald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money\u00a0he owed them.

{"title": "Eric Trump \u2018My Father\u2019s Tax Return Is Irrelevant Because We\u2019re Going To Cancel Taxes For WEALTHY People Anyway\u2019", "text": "President Donald Trump was very active on Twitter Easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns, saying he shouldn\u2019t have to show them since he \u201ceasily won the Electoral College.\u201d Moments after he defended no longer calling China a currency manipulator, now that they are giving him a helping hand with North Korea, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on Twitter. \u201cI did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?\u201d Trump tweeted.\r\n\r\nAs always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trump\u2019s second son argued that his father\u2019s tax return is \u201cirrelevant,\u201d largely because \u201che knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.\u201d\r\n\r\nEric continued, \u201cAnd while we\u2019re on the subject, I kind of have to say, it\u2019s funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. That\u2019s kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, I\u2019m not saying something that\u2019s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that he\u2019s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. That\u2019s a catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to \u201cfix\u201d the broken tax system of the United States. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. It won\u2019t matter soon anyway,\u201d Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that \u201ccancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our way of saying \u2018good job\u2019 to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn\u2019t have to pay tax; like I said, it\u2019s a sort of \u2018thank you\u2019 from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess they\u2019ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going with this. Bottom line, if you\u2019ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And you\u2019re going to have to pretty soon,\u201d Eric concluded."}

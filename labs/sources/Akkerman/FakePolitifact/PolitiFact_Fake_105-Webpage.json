Obama decided your fallen didn\u2019t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn\u2019t be offended. Apparently it\u2019s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm\u2019s way to save the innocent to be honored.\n\nPresident Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\nShare this post and leave your comment below \u2018way to go Mr. President\u2019.\n\nLike our page on facebook.\n\nNote: We at uspostman cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.\n\nSource: guerilla", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced", "generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"description": "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced", "title": "Obama Canceled It, Trump Reinstated It \u2013 A Very Sacred Day is Back -", "url": "http://theexaminer.site/2017/05/08/obama-canceled-trump-reinstated-sacred-day-back/", "image": "https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/breakingnews3.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/breakingnews3.jpg", "description": "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Canceled It, Trump Reinstated It \u2013 A Very Sacred Day is Back -"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2017-05-08T19:23:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://theexaminer.site/2017/05/08/obama-canceled-trump-reinstated-sacred-day-back/", "images": ["http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0c26b097540beb3bd8066f957d90c3b9?s=90&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/breakingnews3.jpg"], "title": "Obama Canceled It, Trump Reinstated It \u2013 A Very Sacred Day is Back -", "url": "http://theexaminer.site/2017/05/08/obama-canceled-trump-reinstated-sacred-day-back/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1494201600000}, "source": "http://theexaminer.site"}

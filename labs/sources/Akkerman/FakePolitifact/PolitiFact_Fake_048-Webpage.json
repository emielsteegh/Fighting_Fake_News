In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: \u201cYou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain\u201d (Exodus 20:7). The word \u201cvain\u201d means \u201cfor no reason\u201d or \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God\u2019s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.\n\n\u201cDr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that \u201cin this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaying the Lord\u2019s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,\u201d Hagee elaborated. \u201cBut, that\u2019s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don\u2019t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.\u201d\n\nThe pastor reprimanded: \u201cBut, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.\u201d\n\nAsked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you\u2019re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God\u2019s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord\u2019s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God\u2019s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker\u2019s good name.\u201d/religionlo.com/\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "USPOLN", "description": "\u201cOne of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord\u2019s name in vain.

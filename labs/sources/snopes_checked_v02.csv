Her salary and net worth have been a constant theme in Republican attacks against her.Browns campaign argued yesterday that her high salary makes her an elitist hypocrite.AdvertisementWithin Warrens $700,000 in teaching and consulting fees is a $43,938 payment she earned in 2010 as a consultant for Travelers Insurance company for cases involving asbestos victims.She is firmly entrenched in the same 1 percent she rails against, and she is more than happy to make tens of thousands of dollars defending powerful insurance companies against middle-class victims, said Jim Barnett, a spokesman for Brown.Despite her claims, you dont need to be a Harvard professor to know that insurance companies dont hire bigtime lawyers because of their interest in protecting the little guy. But Warrens campaign said her work for Travelers was intended to make sure victims got a fair shake in compensation claims.Democrats argue that Warrens high salary does not detract from her conviction that the system needs change to protect the middle class.Elizabeth went from a maintenance mans daughter to a Harvard law professor through hard work and determination, said Kyle Sullivan, a Warren spokesman. Shes made her lifes work understanding the pressures facing families like hers, standing up to the big banks and credit card companies.AdvertisementWarren has also railed at inequities in the tax laws that favor multinational corporations over average wage-earners.A big company like GE pays nothing in taxes and were asking college students to take on even more debt to get an education, she has said.Warrens financial disclosure form shows she owns stock and other investments worth more than $3 million, including between $100,000 and $250,000 in IBM stock. IBM is listed along with GE and 10 other major US companies that relied on loopholes to pay significantly less than the standard corporate rate between 2008 and 2010, according to a report from Citizens for Tax Justice, a politically liberal group.The report said IBM effectively paid an estimated 3.8 percent in taxes over that period, legally avoiding the full 35 percent rate. The group contended that GEs effective rate was negative 61.3 percent over that period.Elizabeth has been clear and unequivocal that large corporations should pay their fair share of taxes - IBM included, Sullivan said in an e-mail.Warrens newest financial disclosure form was filed late last month, a requirement of seeking office. In a previous disclosure, she reported earning $349,375 at Harvard in 2009, in addition to about $182,000 in royalties and consulting fees.The newest disclosure data from Warren were first reported by the Associated Press.Brown was most recently required to file in the spring. It showed he earned a $700,000 advance for his memoir, Against All Odds. He earns $174,000 annually as a US senator.He will not be required to file again until May 15.Warrens form also showed that her house in Cambridge, owned with her husband, Harvard professor Bruce Mann, is worth between $1 million and $5 million. She did not have to disclose Manns salary. He is also a tenured professor at Harvard.Brown and his wife, Gail Huff, have assets worth between about $1 million and $2.3 million - including their home in Wrentham and three Boston rental condos - according to the Associated Press, citing an analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics.","Elizabeth Warrens salary topped $700,000 over two years",1/13/12,Noah Bierman,context,context,context,,1,

After more than two decades following a no testing on animals policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETAs Avon Killing campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Este Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETAs Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: Avon, Este Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits eyes and smeared onto animals abraded skin. Shes urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was dismayed to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away.

The links in the cellulose chain are a type of sugar: -D-glucose. Two unlinked molecules of -D-glucose are pictured at right [1]. The sugar units are linked when water is eliminated by combining the -OH group and H highlighted in gray. Linking just two of these sugars produces a disaccharide called cellobiose [2]. Cellulose is a polysaccharide produced by linking additional sugars in exactly the same way. The length of the chain varies greatly, from a few hundred sugar units in wood pulp to over 6000 for cotton.The cellulose chain bristles with polar -OH groups. These groups form many hydrogen bonds with OH groups on adjacent chains, bundling the chains together. The chains also pack regularly in places to form hard, stable crystalline regions that give the bundled chains even more stability and strength.Cellulose is a major component of wood. Cellulose fibers in wood are bound in lignin, a complex polymer. Paper-making involves treating wood pulp with alkalis or bisulfites to disintegrate the lignin, and then pressing the pulp to matte the cellulose fibers together.Cellulose is found in large amounts in nearly all plants, and is potentially a major food source. Unfortunately, human beings lack the enzymes necessary to cleave the linkages between the sugars in cellulose. In fact, crystallite cellulose is added to some foods to reduce the caloric value.NotesGlucose is a six-carbon sugar that comes in two forms with different optical activity. The  form, pictured above, has the hydroxide group on carbon 1 on the same face of the ring as the -CH 2 OH group. The form has the same hydroxide group on the opposite face from the -CH 2 OH group. Sucrose, or table sugar, is the most familiar disaccaride, made by linking the sugars glucose and fructose in a different way.References and bibliographyC.

mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dirty-dope/,Does Marijuana Contain More Tar Than Cigarettes?,Medical,11-Mar-15,Marijuana cigarettes deposit four times more tar into smokers' lungs than tobacco-based cigarettes.,http://www.lung.org/associations/states/colorado/tobacco/marijuana.html,3,FALSE,No Error,"The American Lung Association is concerned about the health impacts of marijuana use, especially on lung health. We caution the public against smoking marijuana because of the risks it poses to lung health.Scientists are researching marijuana now, and the American Lung Association encourages continued research into the effects of marijuana use on lung health.MarijuanaThe health effects of marijuana are determined in large part by how it's consumed. Marijuana is most commonly smoked using pipes, bongs, paper-wrapped joints, blunts and other devices including those that heat or vaporize marijuana. Marijuana can also be consumed through dozens of different products including candy, brownies capsules, beverages and many more.While this statement focuses on marijuana and lung health, it's important to note that there are other health concerns outside the lungs attributed to marijuana use that are not addressed here, including neurological and cognitive effects.1,2Additionally, there are significant public health concerns associated with pediatric poisonings caused by accidental ingestion of edible marijuana products.3Marijuana SmokeSmoke is harmful to lung health. Whether from burning wood, tobacco or marijuana, toxins and carcinogens are released from the combustion of materials. Smoke from marijuana combustion has been shown to contain many of the same toxins, irritants and carcinogens as tobacco smoke.4-7Beyond just what's in the smoke alone, marijuana is typically smoked differently than tobacco. Marijuana smokers tend to inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than cigarette smokers, which leads to a greater exposure per breath to tar.8Secondhand marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxins and carcinogens found in directly inhaled marijuana smoke, in similar amounts if not more.5 While there is no data on the health consequences of breathing secondhand marijuana smoke, there is concern that it could cause harmful health effects, especially among vulnerable children in the home. Additional research on the health effects of secondhand marijuana smoke is needed.Lung Health and Marijuana SmokeSmoking marijuana clearly damages the human lung. Research shows that smoking marijuana causes chronic bronchitis and marijuana smoke has been shown to injure the cell linings of the large airways, which could explain why smoking marijuana leads to symptoms such as chronic cough, phlegm production, wheeze and acute bronchitis.4,9Smoking marijuana has also been linked to cases of air pockets in between both lungs and between the lungs and the chest wall, as well as large air bubbles in the lungs among young to middle-aged adults, mostly heavy smokers of marijuana. However, it's not possible to establish whether these occur more frequently among marijuana smokers than the general population.4Smoking marijuana can harm more than just the lungs and respiratory system - it can also affect the immune system and the body's ability to fight disease, especially for those whose immune systems are already weakened from immunosuppressive drugs or diseases, such as HIV infection.4,9Smoking marijuana hurts the lungs' first line of defense against infection by killing cells that help remove dust and germs as well as causing more mucus to be formed. In addition, it also suppresses the immune system. These effects could lead to an increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections among marijuana smokers, although there is no clear evidence of such actual infections being more common among marijuana smokers.4,9 However, frequent marijuana-only smokers have more healthcare visits for respiratory conditions compared to nonsmokers.10Studies have shown that smoking marijuana may increase the risk of opportunistic infections among those who are HIV positive, although it does not seem to affect the development of AIDS or lower white cell counts.4,9Another potential threat to those with weakened immune systems is Aspergillus, a mold that can cause lung disorders. It can grow on marijuana, which if then smoked exposes the lungs to this fungus.4 However, it rarely causes problems in people with healthy immune systems.Medical MarijuanaThe American Lung Association encourages continued research into the health effects of marijuana use, as the benefits, risks and safety of marijuana use for medical purposes require further study. Patients considering using marijuana for medicinal purposes should make this decision in consultation with their doctor, and consider means of administration other than smoking.Bottom LineSmoking marijuana clearly damages the human lung, and regular use leads to chronic bronchitis and can cause an immune-compromised person to be more susceptible to lung infections. No one should be exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke. Due to the risks it poses to lung health, the American Lung Association strongly cautions the public against smoking marijuana as well as tobacco products. More research is needed into the effects of marijuana on health, especially lung health.Updated March 23, 2015See our public policy position on marijuana and lung health.",Marijuana and Lung Health,,,context,context,context,,7,

An original version of this article tallied solely reports of casualties released by the Department of Defense, which indicated that 13 members of the military had been killed while deployed, compared to 27 schoolchildren whod died in five shooting incidents this year involving fatalities.Put another way: Twice as many students have been killed in school shootings as have members of the military who were on deployment. An additional four adults were killed in school shootings in 2018  but an additional 29 members of the military have died in training accidents.After our original article ran, Jared Keller, a senior editor at the site Task & Purpose, noted that the Department of Defense releases offered an incomplete picture of service member fatalities. Separate data compiled by the Navy, including the Marines, adds additional casualties to the total. In May, an Air National Guard plane crashed in Georgia killing another nine  an incident not included in the Department of Defenses reports.The DoD doesnt always present a clear picture of accidental mishap-related deaths due to worries about operational security, hence the trouble with [Public Affairs Office] releases, Keller wrote in an email. Back in March 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis even cautioned public affairs officials across the military to be cautious about publicly telegraphing readiness shortfalls because communicating that we are broken or not ready to fight invites miscalculation, as his spokesman put it at the time.On Monday, researcher Zachary Austin sent a more complete set of data about military casualties. Having realized that the Defense Department numbers were incomplete, he began tracking military fatalities separately, tallying 42 this year  including casualties in combat, while deployed and during training exercises. That Air National Guard crash, for example, was during a training exercise.Comparing all fatalities in school shootings with all military deaths, the latter is higher, contrary to the original headline of this article. In both cases, those totals have been boosted by mass casualty events. In the case of the military, 20 of the fatalities occurred in just three aircraft crashes. In the case of schoolchildren, most of the deaths were in Santa Fe, Tex., last week and the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. in February.Austin explained in an email why he started tracking this data.Last year I helped with research that showed more American troops had died from peacetime causes than wartime incidents since 2014, he wrote. Theres no centralized public database like the DCAS (Defense Casualty Analysis System) for training fatalities, and it was often maddening to track down accurate historical data. So I decided that in 2018, I would follow along day-by-day and identify every American service member killed in uniform throughout the year. Whether in a combat zone or not, they all died for their country.What the Defense Department reports is those casualties that dont occur during training incidents.Being a member of the military is still far more dangerous than being a student, of course. There are more than 50 million students in public elementary and high schools and only about 1.3 million members of the armed forces. So far in 2018, a member of the military, deployed or in training, has been more than 50 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting.That said, 2018 is abnormal. Comparing shootings tallied by The Post with Defense-Department-reported casualties in 2017  that is to say, non-training deaths  at no point were the number of military fatalities higher than the number of people killed in school shootings.2018 has been more deadly than 2017 for both groups. In fact, 2018 is shaping up to be unusually deadly at schools. Comparing the number of deaths and the number of shooting incidents this year directly with those through May 18 of 2017, that difference is stark.The number of deaths and school shooting incidents through May 18 are each higher this year than at any point since 2000. There have been three times as many deaths in school shootings so far this year than in the second-most deadly year through May 18, 2005.In fact, there were 36 fatalities in school shootings in total through May 18 of each year from 2000 to 2017  only slightly more than there have been in 2018 alone.Without the shootings in Florida and Texas, the figure is substantially lower. In 2000 through 2017, there were an average of two deaths in five or six school shootings through this point in each year. Without Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Santa Fe, the totals in 2018 would be four deaths in 14 shooting incidents.With them, it is 31 deaths in 16 incidents.",2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than deployed service members,5/18/18,,right,context,right,corrected,10,fj

(Insys or the Company) (NASDAQ:INSY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Insys dronabinol oral solution, SyndrosTM, an orally administered liquid formulation of the pharmaceutical cannabinoid dronabinol, a pharmaceutical version of tetrahydrocannabinol (""THC""). Syndros is approved for use in treating anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS, and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Syndros is currently awaiting scheduling by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.""We are very pleased to announce FDA approval of Syndros. We believe that Syndros will be an important new treatment option for patients suffering from the devastating effects of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, as well as those fighting anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS, said the Companys Chairman, CEO and President, Dr. John N. Kapoor.Syndros is the first and only FDA approved dronabinol solution for oral use. It is a liquid that is easy-to-swallow and allows for the dosage to be titrated to clinical effect. Once Syndros has been opened, it does not need to be refrigerated for 28 days. We believe that these product features coupled with patient support services will prove to be important differentiators for patients and prescribers and will be key drivers of a successful market launch and sustained growth. We expect that Syndros attractive profile will enable rapid market conversion and expansion, making for a significant long-term commercial opportunity for Insys, added Dr. Kapoor.Approximately 9,500 prescribers account for 70% of current dronabinol prescriptions. Insys expects to convert a large portion of the market to Syndros as well as expand the market through direct detailing to physicians, highlighting the improved product profile of Syndros. The Company anticipates launching Syndros in the second half of 2016.IndicationsAIDSSyndrosTM is approved for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS.OncologySyndrosTM is approved for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.Important Safety InformationSyndros may cause psychiatric and cognitive effects and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Patients with cardiac disorders may experience hypotension, hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia.

It supports over 5,000 community-based organizations across America, reaching people in both urban and rural areas.The money for Meals On Wheels is part of the Older American Act, first passed in 1965 as part of LBJs Great Society, and endorsed by every president until Trump. The total cost, which includes other programs, is about The money for Meals On Wheels is part of the Older American Act, first passed in 1965 as part of LBJs Great Society, and endorsed by every president until Trump. The total cost, which includes other programs, is about $2 billion a year, which is less than the government hands out in fossil fuel subsidies every year.On top of that, Trumps On top of that, Trumps proposed budget would drastically reduce the budget of the Food For Peace program, a State Department program that distributes desperately needed food supplies to areas across the globe that have been hit by famine or natural disaster. Since its creation in 1954 by President Eisenhower, it has helped feed more than 3 billion people.It too has a budget It too has a budget that barely scratches $2 billion dollars  a drop in the bucket compared to the $54 billion that Trump is planning to pour into the military budget.Overall, the entire State Department budget also faces the ax, with a proposal to cut the $50 billion budget by almost one-third. It could have been worse, but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a plea to ease the cuts, which in an earlier version were at a staggering 37 percent.The needless cuts to critically important programs like Meals on Wheels and Food For Peace are literally taking food out of the mouths of hungry people. The State Departments work around the world helps millions of people and builds much-needed goodwill for Americas international reputation, which has been dragged through the mud by President Trumps abrasive isolationism.Luckily, there was immediately Republican opposition to many of the proposed cuts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky says his party will not go along with the massive cuts to the State Department budget. Among the cuts, he said Republicans will oppose cuts in funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development. and this is how hes choosing to repay them. In 2014, 10.2 million American seniors faced the risk of hunger  a staggering 15% of all elder Americans. Trump needs to be pouring money into Meals On Wheels, not taking an axe to it. Elderly people voted overwhelmingly for President Trump  and this is how hes choosing to repay them. In 2014, 10.2 million American seniors faced the risk of hunger  a staggering 15% of all elder Americans. Trump needs to be pouring money into Meals On Wheels, not taking an axe to it.It is absolutely appalling that in the richest nation in the world, our seniors cannot live their golden years without worrying where their next meal is coming from. Trumps budget priorities tell you all you need to know about how he really feels about the struggles of the American people.President Trump has made it clear once and for all that he cares nothing for the American people who are unlikely to ever dine with him at Mar-A-Lago and is willing to send millions of the most vulnerable into food insecurity and poverty just so that he can funnel the publics money into the pockets of defense contractors and the ultrawealthy.",Trump Just Announced Plan To End Meals On Wheels For Seniors,3/16/17,,context,right,right,,13,fy

I opened the door, and she was floating in the pool. I ran, and I jumped in.Morgan pulled Emmy out of the water and started CPR while a neighbor called 911. Bode was at a softball game and received a phone call, listening as paramedics continued trying to revive Emmy in an ambulance.In shock, he said. Emmy died the following the day at an Orange County hospital.Theres not a day that goes by that I dont pray for the opportunity to go back to that day and make it different, but now we have this opportunity to make other parents days different, Morgan said.

mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/toilet-rumor/,Did Johnny Carson Cause a Toilet Paper Shortage in 1973?,Entertainment,16-Dec-14,Johnny Carson caused a toilet paper shortage in 1973 after making a joke on The Tonight Show.,http://priceonomics.com/the-great-toilet-paper-scare-of-1973/,4,TRUE,No Error,"For most Americans, 1973 was marred by shortages. In the years first few months, the stock market crashed and lost over 45% of its value -- one of the worst declines in history. In October, an Arab oil embargo sparked an ongoing crisis that saw gas rise from $3 per barrel to nearly $12 per barrel. Quietly, the U.S. spiraled into a period of economic stagnation and malaise it hadn't seen since the Great Depression (albeit, much less serious).Gasoline, electricity, and onions were heavily reported as goods and services that were in limited supply, and Americans cultivated a shortage psychology. Then, right in the midst of this economic turmoil, a toilet paper scare ignited a communal panic attack. Perhaps the most memorable shortage in a decade of shortages, it involved government officials, a famous television personality, a respected congressman, droves of reporters, and industrial executives -- but it was the consumers themselves who were ultimately blamed.Like most scares, the toilet paper fiasco all started with an unsubstantiated rumor. In November of 1973, several news agencies reported a tissue shortage in Japan. Initially, the release went unnoticed and nobody seemed to put much stock in it -- save for one Harold V. Froelich. Froelich, a 41-year-old Republican congressman, presided over a heavily-forested district in Wisconsin and had recently been receiving complaints from constituents about a reduced stream of pulp paper. On November 16th, he released his own press statement -- The Government Printing Office is facing a serious shortage of paper -- to little fanfare.However, a few weeks later, Froelich uncovered a document that indicated the governments National Buying Center had fallen far short of securing bids to provide toilet paper for its troops and bureaucrats. On December 11, he issued another, more serious press release:The U.S. may face a serious shortage of toilet paper within a few months...we hope we dont have to ration toilet tissue...a toilet paper shortage is no laughing matter. It is a problem that will potentially touch every American.In the climate of shortages, oil scares, and economic duress, Froelichs claim was absorbed without an iota of doubt, and the media ran wild with it. Wire services, radio hosts, and international correspondents all sensationalized the story; words like may and potentially were lost in translation, and the shortage was reported as a doomed truth. Television stations aired footage from the Scott Paper Company -- one of the ten largest producers in the U.S. -- of toilet paper rolls shooting off the production line.The ground had been set for a consumer panic; all it needed was a spark to ignite it. When Johnny Carson cracked a joke about toilet paper on his television talk show, things got serious. You know, weve got all sorts of shortages these days, he told 20 million viewers. But have you heard the latest? Im not kidding. I saw it in the papers. Theres a shortage of toilet paper!Absolute madness ensued. Millions of Americans swarmed grocery outlets and hoarded all the toilet paper they could get their hands on. I heard it on the news, so I brought 15 extra rolls, one customer told The New York Times. For my baby shower, said another, I told my party guests to bring toilet paper. In the chaos, company officers and industry leaders told the public to remain calm; store owners ordered astronomical quantities of toilet paper, and set limits of two rolls per customer. Nobody seemed to play by the rules.If people wouldnt hoard and get so excited about this, everything would be okay, a supermarket executive told the St. Petersburg Times. He subsequently increased his toilet paper from 39 cents to 69 per roll, but customers still cleared his shelves each day. Merchandisers struggled to re-stock supplies, as the boxcars they relied on for shipments were in high demand by thousands of other stores.For four long months, toilet paper was a rare commodity. It was bartered and traded, and a black market even emerged before the whole ordeal subsided in February of 1974. Slowly but surely, the American public realized that there had never been a shortage to begin with: rather, it had been artificially created by a pop culture frenzy.In the aftermath, Johnny Carson received the brunt of the blame for propagating the shortage myth and issued a rather serious apology on his comedy talk show. I dont want to be remembered as the man who created a false toilet paper scare, he told viewers, directly facing the camera. I just picked up the item from the paper and enlarged it somewhat...there is no shortage. (Unfortunately, it wouldnt be his last run-in with the toilet industry: in 1976, he was embroiled in a lawsuit with a porta-potty company named Heres Johnny.)As for an explanation of what induced such panic, marketing professor Steuart Britt later enumerated on a theory, which is probably more relevant than ever in todays digital age:Everybody likes to be the first to know something. Its the did-you-hear-that syndrome. In the old days, a rumor took a long time to spread -- enough time to let people discover its validity. Now all it takes is one TV personality to joke about it.Last year, the Venezuelan government faced a similar crisis. When reports surfaced that the government's price controls may lead to a lack of toilet paper, citizens panicked and induced a shortage. In Caracas, the country's capital, lines flowed down the streets when new shipments of rolls came in. The situation got so out of hand that President Jorge Arreaza occupied a toilet paper factory, and issued a statement eerily reminiscent of America's situation in 1983. ""[We] will not allow hoarding or failures in the production and distribution of essential commodities,"" he said. ""There is no deficiency in production.""This post was written by Zachary Crockett.

They pass the day sitting on benches or lying side by side on tiny blue mattresses pressed up against each other on nearly every square inch of the floor in the fenced areas.RELATED: Quiet park in Texas becomes hotspot of illegal immigrantsRELATED: Children fearing gangs fleeing El SalvadorRELATED: How you can helpMORE: Complete immigration coverageThe Nogales facility is a way station where the children are identified, examined for health problems by the U.S. Public Health Service, vaccinated and then moved to other facilities in Texas, Oklahoma and California until they are placed with relatives already in the country to await their day in Immigration Court.On Wednesday morning, bowing to pressure from politicians, the CBP allowed journalists to tour this warehouse of humanity.The tour dispelled rumors of ill treatment. The CBP agents in the building seem to be genuinely compassionate in their interactions with the children. The facility is clean and air-conditioned.But in essence, it is a juvenile prison camp.The children, mostly of high-school and junior-high-school age, are housed behind 18-foot-high chain-link fences topped with razor wire.They are segregated by age and gender: There is one area for those 12 and under. There are areas for boys and girls ages 13 to 15, and still more for boys and girls ages 16 and 17.Young migrants head to USA Border agents caught almost 25,000 unaccompanied minors in fiscal year 2013. Almost 3/4 were boys, and about 1/4 were younger than 14. GuatemalaHondurasEl SalvadorMexicoAll other countriesNylon tarps, tied to the fences, provide a modicum of privacy between the groups. They share the kind of portable toilets used at fairs and construction sites, placed inside the cages and vented with clothes-dryer hoses.There is an occasional frisbee or stuffed animal. One pregnant teen in the older girls' area sat with her back against the fence, holding her belly. Muted televisions blink incongruously, hanging from overhead beams.But most of the children lie motionless on side-by-side mattresses with looks of intense boredom on their faces. Inevitably, given the number of people, it smells of feet and sweat and straw, giving it the look and feel of the livestock areas at the State Fair.Three times a week the children are allowed out of the fenced-in areas to go outside to a concrete playground with a small basketball hoop and benches under a tent where they can congregate.Then, they take showers in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, backed up to warehouse-like bays on the outside of the building. They drop their dirty clothes at the nearby laundry trailer and choose clean ones from boxes lined up on the ground.Meals are served in another caged area. One CBP spokesperson said officials are trying to adapt meals to the children's tastes. For example, some children were not eating, and officials realized that, as Central Americans, they preferred corn flour to wheat flour and subsequently substituted corn tortillas for flour ones.""One little fellow came and asked for a sanwich,"" the official said. (CBP officials asked that the children not be identified by name.)After meals the children are passed through a metal detector.Between the living and eating areas, the building looks like any other warehouse, stacked with pallets of water bottles, cans of beans and other provisions.According to Customs and Border Protection, in the past eight months, agents have apprehended about 47,000 unaccompanied minors who crossed the border into the U.S. illegally from Mexico. Almost three-fourths of the children apprehended are from Honduras, Guatemala or El Salvador.The CBP estimates that apprehensions of minors this year may reach 90,000.The journalists on Wednesday's tour were not allowed to talk to the children, and only one still and one video photographer were allowed to record images.But one 16-year-old Guatemalan, who was caught by the CBP last month and placed with his brother in Phoenix pending his court hearings, told The Arizona Republic on Tuesday night why the youngsters come here: ""From my point of view, because of the poverty and the delinquency,"" by which he meant gangs, in his native country.How we are covering this issueThe Arizona Republic has three reporting teams covering the influx of Central American children arriving in unprecedented numbers in Texas.Go to immigration.azcentral to see daily reports this week.Today's story was written by senior reporter Michael Kiefer.

With two suitcases in tow, his parents  both doctors  left behind a country on the verge of social turmoil. It was 1979, about two years before the countrys authoritarian communist government declared martial law.Niec received a temporary green card and, in 1989, became a lawful permanent resident. He grew up in Michigan, went to medical school, became a doctor, and raised a daughter and stepdaughter.Niec, now 43, never fathomed that his legal status in the United States would become an issue. With a renewed green card, and nearly 40 years in the country, his Polish nationality was an afterthought for Niec, his sister told The Washington Post. He doesnt even speak Polish.But on Tuesday morning, immigration authorities arrested Niec at his home, just after he had sent his 12-year-old stepdaughter off to school. Niec, a physician specializing in internal medicine at Bronson Healthcare Group in Kalamazoo, Mich., has been detained in a county jail ever since, awaiting a bond hearing and possible deportation.Its shocking, said his sister Iwona Niec Villaire, a corporate lawyer. No one can really understand what happened here.According to his notice to appear from the Department of Homeland Security, Niecs detention stems from two misdemeanor convictions from 26 years ago. In January 1992, Niec was convicted of malicious destruction of property under $100. In April of that year, he was convicted of receiving and concealing stolen property over $100 and a financial transaction device.Because Niec was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, stemming from two separate incidents, he is subject to removal, immigration authorities wrote in the notice to appear, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act.Both of the offenses took place when he was a teenager. He associated himself with some bad people his sister said. The first of the incidents involved an altercation with a driver after a car crash, Niecs sister said. He was one of multiple teenagers in the car at the time.The second of those convictions was eventually expunged from his criminal record, his sister said, as part of a guilty plea through Michigans Holmes Youthful Trainee Act, a program intended to help young offenders avoid the stigma of a criminal conviction. But even though the crime was scrubbed off his public record, it can still be used against him for removal from the country, his sister said.ICE has not responded to requests for information from The Washington Post and declined to comment to WOOD-TV. Since Thursday, a spokesman for the ICE Detroit Field Office has not responded to requests for information from MLive, except to say he was looking into the case.According to Kalamazoo County court records cited by MLive, Niec also pleaded guilty in 2008 to operating impaired by liquor. After he completed probation, the conviction was set aside, the plea withdrawn and the case dismissed. He was also charged with domestic violence in 2013 and a jury found him not guilty after a trial, MLive reported.Niecs record has multiple blemishes. But his wife insists that he is not a risk to the public. When he renewed his permanent green card a few years ago, he was given a false sense of security, that it would be enough, she said.Over the decades, tens of thousands of legal residents have been deported for relatively minor offenses. But under previous administrations, immigration authorities have often let low-level offenders off the hook, prioritizing the deportations of violent criminals. A memo from the Obama administration in 2011 directed immigration officials to look at a number of factors, such as familial relationships with U.S. citizens, criminal history, education and contributions to the community, in deciding whether arrests and prosecution are warranted, as The Posts Kristine Phillips reported.But the Trump administration has issued sweeping new guidelines expanding the range of immigrants that count as high priority for deportation, including low-level offenders, and those with no criminal record  regardless of how long they have lived in the country. Now, immigrants feel the threat of deportation more than ever, advocates say, whether they are residing here legally or not.Villaire, the doctors sister, said she previously felt as though green-card holders were like anybody else. She was a green-card holder until she successfully applied for citizenship during law school, she said.You couldnt vote, but that was really the only difference, she said. Thats not the case anymore. . . . Having that status is no longer enough.Lucasz Niec had been considering applying for citizenship, particularly after his July 2016 marriage to his current wife, Rachelle Burkart-Niec, who is an American citizen, she told The Post. But with both of their demanding schedules, they had not gotten around to it yet, she said.Lucasz Niec has been a doctor for more than a decade. He treats patients at three different Bronson hospitals, and is responsible for scheduling all physicians in his group, covering about five hospitals in the area, his wife said. He was picked up by immigration officials on his first day off after working a week straight, including several double shifts.His wife was working her shift as a charge nurse at a Bronson hospital Tuesday morning when she received the phone call from her husband, saying he had been arrested by immigration officers. She was so taken aback that she thought he was pulling a prank on her, she said.Now, after nearly a week in jail, Lucasz Niec has yet to see a judge, and his family says he has received no information from immigration authorities since the day of his arrest.He is needed in the hospital, his wife said. Hospitals in the area are packed full, she said, in part because of the widespread influenza. The Kalamazoo area has seen an increase in flu cases in recent weeks, in numbers well above the four-year average, according to the Kalamazoo County Health and Community Services Department.A number of his hospital colleagues have written letters to an immigration judge, rallying support for Niec, MLive reported.The consensus about his character is overwhelming with no single complaint I have ever heard from anyone over 10 years, Kwsai Al-Rahhal, M.D. wrote, according to MLive. He is loving, caring and respectful.Another colleague, Jose Angelo L. De Leon, M.D., wrote about how Niec often stepped up to take on extra hours due to staff shortages.I cannot say enough about his work ethic and his service to our community, De Leon wrote.Villaire said she is hiring a lawyer for her brother, and is hoping Michigans governor considers pardoning his misdemeanor offenses. She is also seeking other avenues by digging through her familys archives.For example, Villaire knows her mother became a naturalized citizen, but she is not sure when. If she was granted citizenship before Lucasz Niec turned 18, he may already be a citizen by default, Villaire said. But both their mother and father are now deceased, and some crucial documents are missing in the archives they left behind with their children.Deporting Lucasz Niec would mean sending him to a country and culture completely foreign to him, his sister said. He has been back to Poland once, as a teenager, she said. He has maintained no relationships with family or friends there and has never felt much of a connection to his Polish heritage, his sister said, adding that her brother is as American as anyone gets.He cant be deported, his wife said. He cant speak Polish. He wouldnt know where to go. He would be lost.More from Morning Mix:The MoviePass deal: For less than $120 a year, you can see 365 movies.

Cigrand asked his students to write essays on the U.S. flag and its significance. This fell on the anniversary of the Continental Congresss vote in 1777 to adopt the Stars and Stripes, and since 1949, Flag Day has been honored every June 14.To accompany todays theme, we note that 14 states exempt the purchase of U.S. or their states flags from their sales tax. Such an exemption is poor tax policy: states have exempted nearly 60% of consumer sales from sales tax (more than half), often for political reasons. At the same time, many business inputs are subject to tax, meaning that some retail items are taxed multiple times and some (like flags in 14 states) not at all. This micromanagement of consumer decisions disrupts what would otherwise be decisions made on economic factors, not tax incentives or government prodding.Take West Virginia, for instance. Their exemption for flags is the 49th item in a lengthy list of exemptions. In Vermont, its merely the 33rd, but they throw in the wrinkle that its only exempt if sold to (or by) a veterans organization. Another reminder to keep by the register of Vermont flag vendors.Heres the full list:States That Exempt U.S. and State Flags From Sales TaxSTATE STATUS CITATION California If sold by a nonprofit veterans organization Cal.

Vox, MSNBCs Rachel Maddow, this newspaper and others reported similar statistics. Grim details from the church in Charleston, a college classroom in Oregon and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado are still fresh, but you could be forgiven for wondering how you missed more than 300 other such attacks in 2015.At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four mass shootings this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.What explains the vastly different count? The answer is that there is no official definition for mass shooting. Almost all of the gun crimes behind the much larger statistic are less lethal and bear little relevance to the type of public mass murder we have just witnessed again. Including them in the same breath suggests that a 1 a.m. gang fight in a Sacramento restaurant, in which two were killed and two injured, is the same kind of event as a deranged man walking into a community college classroom and massacring nine and injuring nine others. Or that a late-night shooting on a street in Savannah, Ga., yesterday that injured three and killed one is in the same category as the madness that just played out in Southern California.While all the victims are important, conflating those many other crimes with indiscriminate slaughter in public venues obscures our understanding of this complicated and growing problem.

So when a potential Trump cabinet pick gets photographed openly holding sensitive documents, its appropriate to wonder where the outrage is.Kansas Secretary of State and avowed Islamophobe Kris Kobach is being considered to lead the Department of Homeland Security, but failed to put his plans for said agency in a folder, or have a cover sheet, or anything at all to prevent the public from zooming into them:LIKE THIS:The documents appear to contain Kobachs heinous anti-Muslim plans, including expanding the NSEERS (National Security Entry-Exit Registration System) program and reducing the intake of refugees fleeing the mass slaughter of Syrian civilians to zero. Those are his literal first priorities.Kobach created the NSEERS program with John Ashcroft while serving under President Bush. It registered men from 25 predominantly Muslim nations, fingerprinting and questioning them. The program was ended in 2003 and succeeded in deporting 14,000 Muslims who overstayed visas but did not produce a single terrorism arrest and was considered an abject failure by the Bush Administration.Even folks within the Bush administration we worked with at the time knew that it was a waste of time and a waste of resources.  Its clearly profiling. Its clearly singling out Arabs and Muslims. Its a very problematic program, said Abed Ayoub, legal director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.From the accounts we received at the time, it was simply a massive bureaucracy where people would go into the office, be asked some questions and nothing came of it. And in the process, it caused an incredible amount of fear and also almost certainly it inhibited the efforts to gain actionable information from communities that we need to work with to actually combat important threats said Raj Goyle, an ACLU lawyer.It appears that Kobach is still intent on using this program as a discriminatory tool to register and surveil Muslims as well as finding excuses to deport them. The plan itself is absolutely appalling; the way it was revealed to the public is just as disturbing.

Elizabeth Warren's (D., Mass.) office is nearly 10 percent wider than the national average, meaning women in the Massachusetts Democrat's office will have to wait longer than most women across the country to recognize Equal Pay Day.Equal Pay Day, created two decades ago by the National Committee on Pay Equity, is scheduled by using the Census Bureau annual unadjusted gender pay gap to determine how far into the next year women would have to work to match annual earnings of men. Last year's figures, showing that women earned 79.6 percent of what men earned, put Equal Pay Day on Tuesday April 4, more than three months into the calendar year.However, women working for Warren were paid just 71 cents for every dollar paid to men during the 2016 fiscal year, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.The median annual earnings for women staffers, $52,750, was more than $20,000 less than the median annual earnings for men, $73,750, according to the analysis of publicly available Senate data.When calculated using average salaries rather than median, the pay gap expands to just over $26,051, or about 31 percent.Consistent with previous Free Beacon analyses of Senate salary data, only full-time staffers who were employed for the entire period in question were included in the calculations.For example, Warren's former chief of staff Mindy Myers and her male replacement Dan Geldon were not included because neither worked the full year.Among employees employed the entire year, only one woman, Warren's director of scheduling, earned a six-figure salary, at $100,624.88.Five menWarren's director of oversight and investigations ($156,000), legislative director ($149,458), deputy chief of staff ($119,375), Massachusetts state director ($152,310), and deputy state director ($113,750)earned more than Warren's highest paid woman staffer in 2016.Many discount attributing gender pay differences to discrimination, arguing that these comparisons fail to take into account several contributing factors, but Warren is not one of them.Warren said on last year's Equal Pay Day that the American workplace was ""rigged against women"" and called it a ""national day of embarrassment"" for the nation.""Today is Equal Pay Day, and by the sound of it, you would think it's some sort of historic holiday commemorating the anniversary of a landmark day that our country guaranteed equal pay for women,"" Warren said. ""But that's not what this is about. Not even close.""#EqualPayDay isnt a national day of celebration. Its a national day of embarrassment.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) April 12, 2016""The game is rigged against women and families, and it has to stop,"" Warren continued. ""It is 2016, not 1916, and it's long past time to eliminate gender discrimination in the workplace.""Historically, 1995 was the last year where the national pay gap was comparable to the 2016 gap in Warren's office, according to data collected by the group that founded Equal Pay Day.Warren is far from the only politician who pays women less than men.Most notable on the list is failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who paid women less than men first as a senator, then as secretary of state, and as a presidential candidate. Her campaign viewed her tendency to pay women less than men as a campaign vulnerability.Former President Barack Obama regularly spoke out about the gender pay gap, but women working at the White House were paid less than men.Also paying women less than men were Democratic Govs. Jon Bel Edwards (La.), who last month held an ""equal pay summit,"" and Andrew Cuomo (N.Y.), who has signed two executive orders this year to eliminate the wage gap.Warren's office did not respond to inquiries regarding the disparity.",Elizabeth Warren's Female Staffers Made 71% Less Than Male Staffers in 2016,2004-04-17,Brent Scher,right,right,right,,33,

Of this 96% is used to make ammonium nitrate and calcium ammonium nitrate. A relatively small amount of ammonium nitrate is used to make explosives.Some nitric acid is used to make intermediates in the polymer industry, notably in the manufacture of hexanedioic acid (adipic acid) to make polyamides and TDI (toluene diisocyanate or methylbenzene diisocyanate) and dinitrobenzene two of a range of reagents used to make polyurethanes. Nitrobenzene is used to make aniline which is a key reagent for making dyes.Figure 1 Uses of nitric acid.Annual production of nitric acidWorld 55 million tonnes11. 2014, Grand View Research, 2016Manufacture of nitric acidNitric acid production involves two stages:a) oxidation of ammoniab) absorption of the resulting nitrogen oxides(a) Oxidation of ammoniaThis part of the process involves the oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide):The conditions favouring the formation of the products at suitable reaction rates for the reaction are:high pressureexcess aira catalystas high a temperature as is consistent with practicable reaction rates, catalyst efficiency and operating pressureMost plants operate with:moderate pressures (10-13 atm)oxygen (air)an alloy of platinum and rhodium as catalysttemperatures at ca 1200 KThe main advantage of the high pressure is that it substantially reduces the size of equipment and piping required, and hence leads to a reduced capital cost.Where possible, the ammonia is made on the same site. It is filtered to remove any impurities and then mixed with filtered compressed air to give a mixture containing approximately 10% ammonia and 90% air. The exact proportion of excess air depends on the operating pressure and temperature of the plant.The mixture is then passed through one or more converters in parallel, each containing a series of 90% platinum/10% rhodium catalyst gauzes in parallel at 975-1225 K - typically 1200 K in a fixed bed reactor. At least 96% conversion of the ammonia takes place.Figure 2 A gauze of a platinum-rhodium alloy installed in a converter.By kind permission of Johnson Matthey.Rhodium is added to the platinum to give the gauze strength and to reduce the loss of platinum, an important economic factor (0.4 g loss per 1000 kg nitric acid made). This is due to 'hot spots' occurring on the gauze.Recently, it has been found that knitted gauze increases the efficiency of conversion and prolongs the life of the catalyst.Figure 3 Platinum-rhodium wire is woven to produce a knitted gauze.By kind permission of Johnson Matthey.Care has to be taken to minimise oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen by the even more exothermic reaction, favoured by high pressure and an over-heated catalyst:The hot gases leaving the converters are used either to raise superheated steam or to heat the exhaust gas from the absorption tower(s). The steam may be used to generate power in a steam turbine which can then drive the air compressor(s).The hot gases leave the steam raising/heat exchange section at about 425 K.(b) Absorption of the nitrogen oxidesThe gases are further cooled, to below 315 K.Air is added and the gases compressed again (7-12 atm typically). The temperature rises to around 435 K and necessitates further cooling to about 310 K. The additional compression and the cooling aid the reactions, moving the following equilibria to the right:The gases are then passed through one or more towers to meet a stream of water, normally flowing in the opposite direction to the gas. Here, oxidation of the nitrogen monoxide continues and absorption occurs with the formation of nitric acid:Figure 4 Once the reaction between ammonia and oxygen (in the air) is proceeding on the catalytic gauze, the exothermicity of the reaction sustains the temperature and the metal alloy glows red.By kind permission of Johnson Matthey.In processes where significant NO X remains in the gaseous effluent, the effluent is passed through a catalyst (platinum or rhodium on a silicoaluminate, titanium or vanadium compounds) with a fuel, such as hydrogen or methane. The nitrogen oxides are reduced to nitrogen. For example:The temperature at which the reaction is most effective depends on the fuel. For hydrogen, it is ca 450 K. For methane, it is much higher, ca 750 K.The acid from the absorption towers contains typically 56-60% nitric acid by mass but can be manufactured up to ca 68% by mass. Some 99% acid is required for the manufacture of, for example, organic nitro-compounds for the explosives and dye industries. Nitric acid and water form an azeotropic mixture, with a maximum boiling point of 395 K, containing ca 68% nitric acid by mass; thus the concentrated acid cannot be obtained by distillation of the aqueous solution. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used to absorb the water content and then on distillation of this mixture, concentrated nitric acid is obtained.

His book gives a first-hand account not only of the selection process that he endured, but the hectic, colorful, Astro-A-Go-Go world of Houston in the Sixties.He somehow resists the urge to turn his story into self-adulation, bully pulpit, or tedium; an urge that seemingly overpowered many of his fellow astronauts when they 'wrote' their own books. His 'reporter's eye' and droll wit is especially surprising in someone that is a military academy graduate, career officer (he retired with great distinction as a lieutenant general), and a trained engineer.Collin's description of the training and flight of Gemini 10 with 'Corned Beef' John Young is vivid and arresting. His narration of his space walk is so entrancing that it settled the question -- at least, for me -- what it was truly like 'up there'.Apollo 11, the Big Enchilada, is one of the book's finest segments. Collins gives readers such a sense of belonging to the mission themselves that it is irresistible. He describes the training in the simulators, the torture in the 'Vomit Comet' and the 'G-Wheel', and how it was to work with Armstrong and Aldrin. In this last, he is frank and candid. As he notes, it is difficult to have so many 'overachieving sons of overachievers' working together without some friction. He relates a small flare between the other two, after a 'crash' on the lunar surface during simulator training. This incident later appeared, nearly verbatim in the magnificent Tom Hanks 'From Earth to Moon' series.Collins also takes particular care to pay homage and respect to the most unappreciated and neglected of the astronaut's support system -- his wife, Patricia. By the way, he and Patricia are still married (to each other), for about a half century, having been married at Chambley, France, which happens to be where I was born. Although I doubt that the two events are related. At least, one hopes so.This book also has the advantage of giving color and life to other books about the space program, particularly Andrew Chaikin's wonderful 'A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts', and Gene Kranz's 'Failure Is Not An Option'.Collins has that most difficult-to-exercise gift of the writer -- what to leave on the cutting room floor. I always found myself feeling, as I do with a great actor, of wanting just a little more. He never over-explains, and his description, even of the most prosaic and mundane things, is terse, apt, and still vibrant and vivid. I believe that he could write a pilot's checklist and make it absorbing. This is one of the books that I buy in bulk, and give away. Not only is it a record of a fascinating time in history, but it is a fine example of how such a tale should be written.A small aside about the humor in the book; there is a footnote regarding radio procedures among fighter pilots that is simply one of the funniest things that I've ever read. How many footnotes have ever made you laugh aloud? I read the book (in one sitting, I might add, and yes -- it's that good) while occupying a booth next to a plate-glass window in a tavern during an afternoon of mixed thundershowers and blasting sunlight.

Trump because the fate of this nation depends upon sending him, and not Hillary Clinton, to the White House.I know Donald Trump, but were not close friends. However, I believe he will begin on Day One undoing the damage done by President Barack Obama. I stand ready to help him at every turn.Like many, I am deeply concerned about the US Supreme Court. When Trump recently released his list of potential appointees, I grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced. Even more important: Clinton will push the court leftward for generations. She must be stopped.But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners. I never forget The Home Depots small business roots  we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia.I think of the banker who nearly lost his job by taking a risk and giving us a line of credit when we started. He didnt just look at our balance sheet; he believed in our character and determination. Government regulators dont allow this under Dodd-Frank  a law Hillary Clinton wants to make far worse.And going public under Sarbanes-Oxley, a Clinton favorite? Not the company we built, nor thousands of other businesses like ours the nation will never know because they died at birth, strangled by faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government can do it better.Yet the risks we took in the 1970s have resulted in millions of jobs  not just at The Home Depot, but at our suppliers, our vendors, and even our customers businesses. Investors believed in us, and the government did not stop us.We could not do this today, for the same reason why so many Americans have dropped out of the workforce, why their wages have been stagnant, why their health care is a mess, and why our economy has stalled. Its Obama/Clinton-style government thats getting in the way.I have never seen our government as hostile to free enterprise, especially small business, as it is today. It is driving over-regulation, over-taxation, over-litigation, and over-spending. These overs are killing small businesses, which create the majority of new jobs in America.Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector. Thats not just false, its likely the nexus of Trumps massively popular slogan, Make America Great Again. We saw it first hand.The vast majority of early Home Depot associates did not have a college education. But they worked hard and were paid with salaries and stock options. Those options made many people wealthy, and fueled our robust growth.One young man started with us at 17 years of age, bringing carts in from the parking lot. Ultimately, he became a regional president. Imagine Americans vilifying this young man, who became a millionaire and earned every penny of it.What makes America great? Risk, preparation, hard work, and a young mans willingness to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great.Donald Trump is right: To inspire more of these men and women, we must make America great again. Record-breaking numbers of Republican primary voters agree. They overwhelmingly want Donald Trump to lead this sea change, and we believe he can. But he needs to stand on our shoulders; he cannot do it alone.One of the greatest lessons we took away from The Home Depot is to always listen to your customers. Without their input, we surely would have failed. Republican leaders must listen to their customers, too  their voters  and they have spoken clearly.As Americans, the choice is abundantly clear: If you want four more years of President Obama, vote for Hillary Clinton; if you want to take the country in a new direction, vote for Donald Trump.Make no mistake, Republicans who refuse to stand behind their partys nominee are electing Clinton, whether they cast their ballots for her or not. I have a message for the #NeverTrump crowd: Enough already. Donald Trump is our presumptive nominee and it is time to get over wishing it were not so. If you dont, change your social media hashtag to #HillaryGOP.As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bush  and who has contributed to candidates for a generation  I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.Bernie Marcus is co-founder of The Home Depot and chairman of The Marcus Foundation.",Why I Stand With Donald Trump,2006-01-16,,right,right,right,,48,

This is just one man's observations.FBI Director James Comey said on July 5 that Hillary Clinton should not be charged for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Here's what he said, in three minutes. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)1. Clinton had 13 mobile devices during her four years at the State Department and five iPads.She was unable to find any of the mobile devices to turn over to the FBI but did find three of the iPads.2. Clinton never sought approval to conduct state business on her own private email server despite ""an obligation to do so.""3. Former secretary of state Colin L. Powell advised Clinton to keep it secret that she was using a BlackBerry to conduct official business.4. A note sent to all State Department employees on Clinton's behalf warned them against the risks of using personal email addresses for official business.Clinton told the FBI she did not remember sending that memorandum.5. The State Department, regularly during Clinton's tenure, sent out notes warning of the dangers of using mobile devices not up to agency security standards.6. Clinton neither participated in conversations with her lawyers about how to determine which emails were professional and which were personal, nor did she provide them any guidance as to the locations of those emails.7. Clinton told the FBI the decision to delete her personal emails was because she didn't need them anymore, not because she was trying to avoid State Department, FBI or Freedom of Information Act requests.8. Three weeks after the New York Times broke the story of the existence of Clinton's email server , a number of Clinton's emails were deleted  allegedly because of a missed request by Clinton's State Department chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, in 2014.9. The FBI found 17,448 work-related and personal emails that Clinton did not turn over to the State Department.The FBI report offers no breakdown of how many of those 17,448 were work-related and how many were personal.10. Clinton told the FBI that she was unaware that the ""C"" marking on emailed documents meant they were confidential.11. Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton associate, sent the secretary of state 179 email memos during her time as the nation's top diplomat.12.

It is a homosexual problem.Despite former Presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney and John McCain both snubbing the groups summit previously, Trump attended on Friday.In his speech to the group, Mr Trump turned a blind eye to their long history of stirring anti-LGBT hate sentiment, focusing on generic religious liberty.He said: I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership Thank you. Amazing, amazing group.Trump continued: So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like youve never seen before.Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty.In his speech, Trump pledged to scrap the Johnson Amendment, which bans tax-exempt churches from directly endorsing or opposing political candidates, effectively giving a turbo-boost to the work of the FRC.He said: The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, theyre unable to do so.If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And its not going to be hard.He also vowed to appoint more justices like the late Justice Scalia, who was known for his bitter dissents against pro-LGBT rulings. Scalia consistently opposed LGBT rights rulings on the court, from the repeal of sodomy laws right through to the equal marriage.Trump said: Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia.The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others and you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.We are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what were looking for, OK?I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written.Trump also praised anti-sodomy campaigner Phyllis Schlafly.He continued: Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis.Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America.She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we cant simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realisation that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. Phyllis understood that.Trump has faced questions about his ties to Perkins in the past.Earlier this year, when Trump was mocked for misquoting the Bible in a speech, he revealed it had been co-written by Mr Perkins.He later made a $100,000 donation to Perkins church  raising serious questions about financial conduct.",Donald Trump rallies with anti-LGBT preacher who claims paedophilia is a homosexual problem,2009-12-16,,right,right,right,,50,

mostly false,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/non-citizens-vote-registered-dmv/,Are Non-Citizens Being Registered to Vote Without Their Knowledge?,Ballot Box  Politics,06-Feb-17,Green Card holders are being illegally registered to vote without their knowledge or consent in order to create legal grounds for their deportation.,http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/nyregion/17voting.html,3,TRUE,No Error,"Officials with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processes immigrants visas and naturalization petitions, say the agency does not keep records of how many noncitizens have been caught violating voting laws. Many election law experts said there was no evidence that the violations happened frequently  or at least enough to skew election results.But for those who do register to vote and get caught, the penalties can be severe. Lawyers at the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit group for low-income New Yorkers, said that they had handled at least eight cases in the past few years involving permanent residents who faced deportation because they had registered to vote. Noncitizens who are convicted in criminal court of having made a false claim of citizenship for the purpose of registering to vote in a federal election can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year, then deported.Advocates for immigrants said that in most cases, those who violated the voting law did so unwittingly.It really annoys me that theyre just trying to do their civic duty for no pecuniary gain at all, yet they wind up in removal proceedings, said Jeffrey N. Brauwerman, a lawyer in Coral Gables, Fla., and a former immigration judge, who has represented four immigrants that the government tried to deport for registering to vote.Some groups, including the Heritage Foundation, contend that illegal voting by immigrants may be more widespread than anyone realizes. They say it disenfranchises legal voters and warrants tougher enforcement.In a 2008 report, Hans A. von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the foundation, wrote: Lax enforcement of election laws permits individuals who have not entered the American social compact or made a commitment to the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws, and the U.S. cultural and political heritage to participate in elections and potentially change the outcome of closely contested races.No group appears to have made the issue a central cause this election season, Mr. von Spakovsky said, but that could change if some results in crucial races are close. Thats when people will potentially pay attention,"" he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyWilliam G. Wright, a spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the agency did not provide specific information on voting rights when granting green cards. But he pointed out that voter registration forms explain that an applicant must be an American citizen.Immigrants and their advocates, however, say there is widespread confusion, even among native-born Americans, about who is allowed to vote. Volunteers, whether working for political parties or nonpartisan causes, sometimes give incorrect advice when registering new voters.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And elections officials around the country do not customarily verify the citizenship of newly registered voters. Arizona is the only state that requires proof of citizenship; Georgia passed a similar law, which has not taken effect.Mr. Joseph, 53, said that when he encountered the registration volunteers in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, in 1992, he told them he had a green card. They said that if Im paying taxes, I have a right to vote, he said.He mailed his application to the citys Board of Elections and soon received a voter registration card.I assume that every application should be checked out, and I assumed that if there was something wrong, then Id get a call, said Mr. Joseph, a welder at a New Jersey construction company who has five children, three of them American citizens by birth.Under Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines, a noncitizens vote does not always scuttle a bid for citizenship. The agencys officers are required to evaluate the circumstances of the violation, as well as the moral character of the applicant, and decide whether the law has been intentionally violated.In Mr. Josephs case, the agency said that intent was irrelevant  and rejected his application. Whether or not making false claim of U.S. citizen was intentional or not, you nonetheless voted in an election in violation of the law, his rejection letter said. Therefore you failed to satisfy the good moral character requirement under the law.The case was sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation proceedings, which Mr. Joseph is trying to stop.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyHis lawyer, Olivia Cassin, said she saw nothing in the agencys case file that suggested officials had fully evaluated his character. Hes a desirable person, paid taxes, supported his children, committed zero crimes, said Ms. Cassin, a staff lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.Officials with Citizenship and Immigration Services said they were not permitted to discuss the details of individual cases. Each case is complex, and the decision in that case is based on our adjudicators looking at all the evidence provided, said Chris Bentley, a spokesman with the agency.But Ms. Cassin and other immigrant advocates said the agency was being too strict. The advocates pointed out that, in some cases, immigration judges had relied upon the same evidence to rule against deportation that immigration officials had used to deny citizenship.In eight New York cases that Ms. Cassin recalled, none of the immigrants were deported, and all were able to maintain their permanent residency. In one, she said, the clients application for naturalization was reopened and eventually approved.Mr. Joseph was supposed to have an immigration hearing last month, but the judge postponed it until early next year. He said he now regrets signing that registration form 18 years ago.I wish I could take it back, he said.",Immigrants Registered to Vote Face Deportation Fears,10/17/10,Kirk Semple,context,right,ambiguous,right/context,54,x

The most remarkable thing about urban legends is that so many people believe them and pass them on. What is it about these stories that makes people want to spread the word?A lot of it has to do with the particular elements of the story. As we saw in the last section, many urban legends are about particularly heinous crimes, contaminated foods or any number of occurrences that could affect a lot of people if they were true. If you hear such a story, and you believe it, you feel compelled to warn your friends and family.A person might pass on non-cautionary information simply because it is funny or interesting. When you first hear the story, you are completely amazed that such a thing has occurred. When told correctly, a good urban legend will have you on the edge of your seat. It's human nature to want to spread this feeling to others, and be the one who's got everyone waiting to hear how the story turns out. Even if you hear it as a made-up joke, you might be tempted to personalize the tale by claiming it happened to a friend. Basically, people love to tell a good story.But why does an audience take this at face value, instead of recognizing it is a tall tale or unsubstantiated rumor? In most cases, it has to do with how the story is told. If a friend (let's call her Jane) tells you an urban legend, chances are she will say it happened to a friend of somebody she knows. You trust Jane to tell you the truth, and you know she trusts the person who told her the story. It seems pretty close to secondhand information, so you treat it as such. Why would Jane lie?Of course, Jane isn't really lying, and her friend wasn't lying to her -- both of them believe the story. They are, however, probably abbreviating the story somewhat, and you will probably abbreviate it yourself when you pass it on. In this situation, the story happened to a friend of one of your friend's friends, but to simplify things, you'll probably just say it happened to a friend of Jane's, or even to Jane herself. In this way, every person who relays the story gives the impression that he or she is only two people away from one of the characters in the story, when in reality, there are probably hundreds of people between them.Now, we'll take a look at where urban legends come from.",How Urban Legends Work,5/16/01,,context,irrelevant,irrelevant,,57,fy

HHS is the agency that is taking in children when they are separated from their families.An HHS official added that the agency expects to be taking about 250 kids each day at least for the next two months. If that estimate holds, HHS could be caring for 18,500 more children by the end of August.The HHS official said as of Friday, HHS was already holding 11,500 children, which means the total could hit 30,000 by August.The practice of separating children from illegal immigrant adults has become highly controversial in the last few weeks, and is something Democrats have highlighted as a practice that needs to stop.[Related: GOP looks to end family separation at the border in immigration bill]The Trump administration has defended the policy by saying illegal immigrants need to know that if they try entering the U.S., they will be prosecuted, which could lead to separation from their children. Officials have said U.S. citizens face the same risk when they commit crimes.[Also read: Ted Cruz defends Trump's policy of separating families of illegal immigrants]But administration officials have also said they support a change to the federal law that requires prosecution and family separation, and have blamed Democrats for current law.Illegal immigration along the southwestern U.S. border has spiked in the last few months, even though administration officials have said they expect Trump's zero-tolerance policy to eventually dissuade more from coming. A Justice Department spokesman told the Washington Examiner last week the zero-tolerance policy is not expected to lead to a decline in the number of illegal immigrants attempting to make the trek to the U.S. from primarily Central American countries until early fall.Under current practice, HHS takes care of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children as well as now those under the age of 18 who must be cared for while the adults they were apprehended with are prosecuted for illegal entry. This spring, Sessions directed federal prosecutors stationed at the border to bring charges against all migrants that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers took into custody.However, family units that arrive at ports of entry and request asylum will not be prosecuted because they have not attempted to enter the country illegally, several DHS officials confirmed to the Washington Examiner. They will also be kept together as they go through the asylum process. These groups are detained in DHS facilities while minors are directed to HHS.In an attempt to secure housing for the coming flood of children, HHS selected the Tornillo Land Port of Entry near El Paso, Texas, last week as the first back-up site to temporarily house around 360 minors.The Trump administration is also advancing a plan to tentatively house unaccompanied minors in tent cities located on three Texas military bases due to increasing border apprehensions and a shortage of beds for the underage immigrants.""[Health and Human Services] is running out of space because of the implications of the zero tolerance policy, but also because we continue to see this uptick in numbers,"" an official confirmed to the Washington Examiner last week.HHS officials are looking at Fort Bliss near El Paso, Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, and Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, the official confirmed.","Trump administration could be holding 30,000 border kids by August, officials say",6/18/18,,context,irrelevant,irrelevant,photo,58,fy

When the stress of everyday life pushes you to search for the most remote point on Earth, you might be surprised to learn there are actually a few to choose from.But if you have decent sea legs, nothing beats the furthest point from land, also known as the ""oceanic pole of inaccessibility"".Since its official title is a bit of a mouthful, it has been nicknamed Point Nemo, after author Jules Verne's famous seafaring anti-hero Captain Nemo. The name means ""no-one"" in Latin, which is fitting for a place so rarely visited by people.Point Nemo is located over 1,000 miles (1,600km) equidistantly from the coasts of three far-flung islands. Ducie Island (one of the Pitcairn islands) is to the north, Motu Nui (of the Easter Island chain) is to the north-east and Maher Island (off the coast of Antarctica) is to the south.It is a rather peculiar place.Experts had long discussed the geographical conundrum of finding the middle of the ocean, but it took modern technology to provide a full solution. The oceanic pole of inaccessibility was officially discovered in 1992 by survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela.Instead of launching an expedition, Lukatela stayed on dry land and calculated the point's location using specialist computer software. Rather than simply putting a pin in a flat projection of the Earth, the software incorporated the planet's ellipsoid shape for maximum accuracy.It seems unlikely that the point will move significantly within the foreseeable future.""The location of three equilateral points is quite unique, and there are no other points on the Earth's surface that could conceivably replace any one of those,"" says Lukatela. It is possible that better measurements, or coastal erosion, would shift the location of Point Nemo, ""but only in the order of metres"".Point Nemo is so far from land, the nearest humans are often astronauts. The International Space Station orbits the Earth at a maximum of 258 miles (416km). Meanwhile the nearest inhabited landmass to Point Nemo is over 1,670 miles (2,700km) away.In fact the whole region around Point Nemo is well known to space agencies.The area is officially known to space agencies as the ""South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area"". In particular, the Russian, European and Japanese space agencies have long used it as a dumping ground, because it is the point on the planet with the fewest human inhabitants and the quietest shipping routes.Over a hundred decommissioned spacecraft are thought to now occupy this ""spacecraft cemetery"", from satellites and cargo ships to the defunct space station Mir.In 1997, oceanographers recorded a mysterious noise less than 1,240 miles (2,000km) east of Point NemoRather than single monuments to the history of space travel, the remains are spread across the ocean floor in bits, says space archaeologist Alice Gorman of Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.""Spacecraft do not survive atmospheric re-entry whole,"" says Gorman. ""Most of them burn up in the fierce heat. The most common components to survive are fuel tanks and pressure vehicles, which are part of the fuel system. These are generally made of titanium alloys or stainless steel, often encased in complex carbon fibres, which are resistant to high temperatures.""While smaller fragments burn up in the atmosphere, leaving nothing but an impressive light show, Gorman says the larger parts of the 143-tonne Mir were reputed to have washed up on Fijian beaches, while the rest sank to the ocean depths.""Like shipwrecks, they create habitats that will be colonised by anything and everything that lives at that depth,"" says Gorman. ""Unless there is residual fuel that leaks out, there should not be a hazard to aquatic life.""Rumours have long swirled about what might live at Point Nemo.Despite writing 66 years before its discovery, science fiction author HP Lovecraft chose a site eerily close to the oceanic pole of inaccessibility for R'lyeh, the home of his legendary tentacle-faced creature Cthulhu.D'Hondt describes it as ""the least biologically active region of the world ocean""In 1997, oceanographers recorded a mysterious noise less than 1,240 miles (2,000km) east of Point Nemo. This led to a great deal of excitement, and a fair bit of trepidation. The sound, dubbed ""the Bloop"", was louder than even a blue whale  leading to speculation that it was made by some unknown sea monster.However, the Bloop has since been confirmed to be the sound of ice by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When large icebergs crack and fracture, they generate powerful, ultra-low-frequency sounds. Subsequent recordings of known icequakes have shared similarities with the Bloop.So if Point Nemo is not really home to an octopus-man-dragon, what exactly does live there? According to oceanographer Steven D'Hondt of the University of Rhode Island in Narragansett, possibly not much.This is because the oceanic point of inaccessibility sits within the South Pacific Gyre. This is a massive rotating ocean current: bound east and west by the continents of South America and Australia, north by the equator, and south by the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current.It is an extreme environment, but bacteria thrive hereThe waters within the gyre are stable, with a surface temperature of 5.8C (42F) at Point Nemo according to data from NASA satellites. The rotating current blocks cooler, nutrient-rich water from coming in.What's more, because the region is so isolated from land masses, the wind does not carry much organic matter.As a result, there is little to feed anything. With no material falling from above as ""marine snow"", the seafloor is also lifeless. D'Hondt describes it as ""the least biologically active region of the world ocean.""Still, there are a few exceptional points where unique creatures can survive.Point Nemo is near the southern end of the East Pacific Rise, a submarine line of volcanic activity that stretches up to the Gulf of California. It marks the boundary of the Pacific and Nazca tectonic plates, which are gradually moving apart. Magma wells up in the gap between the plates, creating hydrothermal vents that blast out hot water and minerals.On a calm day, the sea surface in the heart of the South Pacific Gyre is simply beautifulIt is an extreme environment, but bacteria thrive here, gaining their energy from chemicals released by the eruptions. In turn, the bacteria sustain larger creatures. These include the ""yeti crab"", which was first observed in 2005 and named for its hairy appearance.There is still much to be discovered in these depths, but its remoteness makes Point Nemo an expensive and challenging destination for research. Apart from the occasional round-the-world yacht race, there are hardly any visitors. That means it is unlikely to pop up on your social media, so you have to use your imagination to picture it.""On a calm day, the sea surface in the heart of the South Pacific Gyre is simply beautiful  clear cornflower blue, with a violet tone  because it contains so little particulate matter and so little living material,"" says D'Hondt.Or it would be, if it were not for littering.When the virtual band Gorillaz released their 2010 album Plastic Beach, they created a fictional backstory: supposedly the music had been recorded at a recording studio built on marine debris at Point Nemo.HP Lovecraft chose a site eerily close to the oceanic pole of inaccessibility for R'lyeh, the home of his legendary tentacle-faced creature CthulhuThis is not as entirely far-fetched as it might sound. A study published in 2013 confirmed that there is a garbage patch within the South Pacific Gyre. The biggest accumulation of waste was at the centre, around 1,550 miles (2,500km) north-east of Point Nemo.The garbage is mainly plastic waste like polystyrene, film, fishing line, fragments and pellets washed from ships and coastlines. The rotating current traps the trash, breaking it down into tiny pieces. Biologists believe the rubbish could could throw the ecosystem out of balance by helping some species proliferate while others suffer.Even in the most remote spot on the planet, it seems there is no escaping humanity's wasteful habits.Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

This curation endeavor would soon birth Your News Wire.In the months after Trump's election, several British papers published accounts criticizing YNW as a purveyor of fake news, with one reporting that a European Union task force set up to combat Russian propaganda had classified the outlet as a proxy. While the couple acknowledges that state-sponsored Russia Today is a favored source (""They have angles,"" notes Adl-Tabatabai, ""and sometimes their angles vaguely match our angles""), they deny any links to the Kremlin. Such a claim, contends Adl-Tabatabai, is ""part of an overall political game that's being played by big corporate media outlets to purge independents.""The negative attention has had a bottom-line impact. Google AdSense dropped YNW from its network, resulting in what Adl-Tabatabai notes was a 60 percent drop in revenue (he declines to reveal dollar figures). He says he learned from a ""brutally honest"" discussion with an AdSense rep that there are internal divisions at Google over whether to work with publishers like YNW.

Google wouldn't reveal whether it was aware that NewsPunch was simply YNW with a new logo and tagline. At any rate, the site within days reverted to Your News Wire  because of technical difficulties, says Adl-Tabatabai, who adds it's still ""moving toward a rebrand.""He and Treadway regularly find themselves in the sights of Snopes, the web's best-regarded fact-checker, which wrote in May of YNW's ""track record of promoting false information.""

Snopes head David Mikkelson observes that the couple also has a history of publishing what he considers defamatory claims about his own operation, and Snopes' legal counsel has sent cease-and-desist notices.Given Snopes' role as one of Facebook's official partners in efforts to address the spread of misinformation, Adl-Tabatabai says he has been weighing his options for a campaign against what he sees as a competitor with an unfair stranglehold on dictating reality  a move right out of Trump's anti-press playbook.

Thus, the logic goes that the Georgia Guidestones (CFR  Monsanto) + quotemining H.W. Bush  RFID chipped flu vaccines ( book of revelation) = FEMA death camps.Origin of the phrase [ edit ]One of the earliest standalone uses of the phrase was the title of the 1920 book The New World Order by Frederick C. Hicks,[1] but it is usually misattributed to H.G. Wells' 1940 book of the same name. The phrase had previously been used by Nicholas Murray Butler in his 1917 book A World in Ferment.[2] The phrase was also used in a 1940 essay by occultist writer Alice Bailey in her posthumously published 1957 compilation The Externalisation of the Hierarchy. To Hicks, Wells, and Bailey, the term meant a benevolent social democracy that would soon emerge, while Butler used the term to describe World War I as it was being waged. Conspiracy theorists, however, believe the term goes back earlier to Cecil Rhodes and Lionel Curtis, circa 1909.Its popularization among conspiracy theorists can be traced to over forty years ago when the phrase appeared in the 1972 book None Dare Call It Conspiracy by John Birch Society writer Gary Allen. He claimed it to be the ""code word"" the International Communist ConspiracyTM would use when they were ready to unveil their secret plans for a socialist world government. This book was widely read in right-wing conspiracy-minded circles during the 1970s, and is probably the source of the hysteria that later erupted over the term.The first high-profile use of the phrase by a politician was in a 1991 speech given by George H.W. Bush after the Cold War ended.[3] In that speech, Bush was explaining that, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia would cooperate rather than compete. All international relations experts agree that at that point, the old order of bipolarity had ended and a new system was coming into place. The exact nature of the new system has been greatly debated over the years.As outlined below, the meaning for conspiracy theorists went in a different direction.Meaning for conspiracy theorists [ edit ]The New World Order conspiracy started as an extension of old John Birch Society conspiracy theories about the role of the United Nations. This theory claimed the UN was merely a tool of the Communists, and that the end goal was the complete subjugation of the United States to the United Nations. This would then set up a world government where all of the freedoms Americans hold dear would be abolished. Usually, top American officials were claimed to be in on the conspiracy.As is usual with conspiracy theories, there are many contradictory variations on the theory. The most popular variation used to maintain that international bankers (a common code word for the Jews) were pulling the strings of both the US and USSR. Others of a more obvious racist bent flat-out said that Zionists were the ones responsible (like always). As many conspiracy theorists also believe the Jews are responsible for either the banks or Communism (or both), these three strands are often woven together into a completely ridiculous whole.Supporters of this theory can say to a certain degree who is part of it, but no one can determine who isn't part of the NWO. International organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, European Union, the United Nations, and NATO are often listed as core NWO organizations, and presidents and prime ministers of nations are routinely included in the conspiracy. A slightly different version of the NWO theory goes as far as saying these families and persons are all part of the same bloodline. Most prominent families such as the Rockefellers, Morgans, and Du Ponts, as well as European monarchs, are said to be important members as well. Specifically, the Rothschild family is often accused of being among the masterminds.Some versions of the theory are just reworkings of the old Illuminati conspiracy theory, where a secret society is said to be working behind the scenes for world domination or some other nefarious purpose. Sometimes, the Illuminati may be explicitly mentioned in these versions of the theory. Other versions will reference more recent groups such as the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group (which, unlike the Illuminati, actually do exist), which are commonly mentioned. Freemasons are also regularly cited as perpetuating a conspiracy for world domination. The Pope, or the Roman Catholic Church in general, are believed by some to be orchestrating the NWO. Still others point to the Church of Scientology as the true culprits. Many other manifestations of the NWO theory characterize it as an international Jewish conspiracy, although many others see conspiracy leadership elsewhere and are not anti-Semitic (explicitly, at least). Famous crank and perennial candidate Lyndon LaRouche, for example, sees the British as the leaders of the conspiracy and the Jews merely as pawns of British power.It is because the NWO has limitless power and is worldwide in reach that it can be alleged to have been behind just about any event anywhere. This makes it less of a conspiracy theory than a framework into which any conspiracy theory can be shoehorned (a ""super-conspiracy theory""). This also commonly involves a belief in pseudohistories (usually ripped off from the cranks of yesteryear) in an attempt to explain the origins of the NWO. For example, more modern incarnations of the NWO theory often draw on older Freemason and Illuminati theories and claim that groups like the Bilderbergs grew out of these earlier conspiracies.The conspiracy theory remained marginal until the 1990s and the growth of the Internet. At that point, theorists started to see Bill Clinton as the biggest pawn of the NWO. The events at both Ruby Ridge and Waco were considered part of the attempt to remove American liberties pursuant to an eventual takeover by either FEMA or the UN. During this era, the theory was most closely connected to certain paleoconservatives, and to the burgeoning militia movement. Pat Robertson gave a boost to belief in the theory with his 1992 book The New World Order. Increasingly preposterous variations on the theory proliferated during the early to mid-1990s, such as allegation that mysterious fleets of black helicopters were being prepared for military occupation of the U.S.Out of one, many [ edit ]As is typical of many conspiracy theories, there is not one theory, but several contradictory ones.Because of the various contradictory theories it is a good idea to get a NWO conspiracy theorist to explicitly state which particular ""theory"" he is backing. There are two reasons for this:Conspiracy theorists frequently don't know much about their own theory, and consequently can't give a direct answer - only that there must be a conspiracy.In the event that the person does have a clear idea, you obviously must know which one they support so as not to waste your time talking about another one.Relation to Explanations of Actual, Real, Power Structures [ edit ]In reality, there are power differences. There are forms of power, especially by Western governments and businesses in the form of: international organization bias, military interventions, economic exploitation, and dominant cultural exportation (Yeah Barbie!). For more credible (but not universally agreed upon) theories or arguments of world power structures, see Wikipedia on ""Core-Periphery Theory,"" ""Criticism of United Nations,"" ""Economic Exploitation,"" and ""Cultural Imperialism.""The most striking difference between reality and the Conspiracy Theory is the CT's idea that everyone with power is in strict collaboration. In actuality, there is much competition, backstabbing, and differing goals between Presidents, military leaders, business managers, and others in power. It is plausible (and often shown true) that world leaders are not always innocent or transparent and that leaders have more control than many people might prefer as evidenced in news leaks and controversies around the world.NWO theories today [ edit ]It is hard to imagine any US president giving up American sovereignty to any organization, particularly the UN. However, some especially paranoid conservatives and libertarians believed that once the Democrats came into power in 2008, it was only a matter of time until a socialist one-world government was instated and American sovereignty given up. Dissenters would naturally have to be controlled or eliminated somehow. The loss of Democratic Congressional power in the 2014 mid-term elections discredited that idea, and the paranoid conservatives were somewhat silenced.It is believed that there are to be numerous internment camps [4] located within the United States and that these internment camps will start being seen as signs before any action is taken. These camps are to be used to store any Americans who protest or give any sort of fight against the Secret Service Guard that is to be used to control the population and new laws.The version found on the religious right mixes the conservative tropes with biblical end times prophecies. The general theme is that the anti-christ will come to Earth as the head of the UN and use it to implement a world government and one world religion, which will either be theistic Satanism, atheism or a New Age belief, depending on which conspiracy theorist you listen to. The prophecies of revelations are of immense relevance here. Anyone who rejects the Mark of the Beast will be sent to die in FEMA camps. Texe Marrs, Mark Dice and Alex Jones are the main proponents of this theory today, though this isn't counting the many vocal supporters with a high number of followers on YouTube. They generally consider the more high-profile supporters who stay off their rabbit hole to be huge shills for the NWO.[5]In the most recent, more liberal version, instead of the UN taking sovereignty away from the US, the US (through the UN) plans to conquer the entire world. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are thus believed to be the first stages in that plan. In this version, it is the neocons who are the masters behind the NWO. An adherent to this theory is Latin-American rapper Immortal Technique.Another version of this from the left stems from the anti-globalization movement, in which transnational corporations will implement global corporate governance.[6] This form of the conspiracy is where left and right often bleed together as right-wing populist and producerist views oppose globalization as well. This can be seen in third positionism and the political campaigns of Lyndon LaRouche.It should be noted that there are real power structures, non-transparency, etc. Many of these fringe interpretations of world affairs overlap with more accepted theories/models. See above ""Relation to Actual, Real World Power Structures.""UFOs and the NWO [ edit ]The New World Order conspiracy has gained currency within the UFO sub-culture as well. In this form of the conspiracy, the aliens are actually in control of the secret cabal running the NWO or are shapeshifters taking the form of world leaders. This also usually involves theorized cover-ups of Area 51, Roswell, and the forged ""Majestic 12"" documents as part of the NWO conspiracy.Evidence [ edit ]Much of the imagined evidence for the theory rests on the symbolism found on various items, such as the Great Seal of the United States and other items on the US one dollar bill, and their supposed connections with ancient symbols of evil or the Masons. The phrase ""novus ordo seclorum,"" which appears on the Great Seal and one dollar bill, is often mistranslated as ""new world order"" or ""new secular order"" in order to boost this theory, but the actual translation is ""new order of the ages."" Company logos have been associated with the NWO for something as little as a triangle, eye, or compass.Much is often made of the recurrence of 13, which is connected to the ancient witches' covens or the Masons. Other examples include strange murals in the Denver International Airport, Masonic signs on buildings (particularly in Washington DC) and pentagrams worked into city plans.This, of course, neglects the importance of the 13 Colonies to the founders of the United States. On the other hand, this could be subject to still more paranoia. The question of why an organisation bent on ruling the world without anybody knowing would then proceed to plaster its logo over everything is generally ignored.The lack of concrete evidence of plotting or of actions taken by the NWO is usually ascribed to the skill of the plotters in covering up such activities.Most of the evidence provided is frivolous. For example in this video ""Exposing"" the cult of Saturn[7] the first thing he shows is a children's game with cubes worshipping a rainbow cube, apparently resembling the Saturn cube. The rainbow cube, while giving the speech, is standing on three children's blocks with the letters ""NWO"".Criticism [ edit ]The idea that the US, as well as a lot of other countries and supranational organizations, which are notoriously bad at keeping secrets[8], would be able to hide a conspiracy of this magnitude is simply absurd. When one further considers the current antipathy felt between some of the leaders of the UN and the US and you have a theory that really is laughable. The US and UN cannot even agree on any of the basic accords that come before the UN, with the US often either trying to push activities that the rest of the UN blocks or else vetoing activities that the rest of the UN believes in.[9]In order to explain the above, believers claim that the US deliberately humiliated itself by releasing its own secrets in an effort to give the impression that it can't keep them - and this is a cover for the real secrets which it can keep. A similar argument is made about the antipathy felt between the leaders of the UN and the US.Yes, they seriously claim that all evidence to the contrary is disinformation. This means that the theory is impossible to falsify.Other caveats are that:Even if the NWO was established and everyone was under the same flag/religion/whatever, it remains to be seen how long it would last before breaking apart due to massive civil unrest (a single country is one thing; an entire planet is something else entirely), and/or internal dissensions, for whatever reasons, between its rulersunless of course they used magical mind control devices able to affect everyone on Earth, including perhaps themselves.Some versions of the conspiracy say the global government will establish what is basically a neo-liberal regime. So far so good... until someone sees these versions are often proposed by libertarians. So what's the point?... But then again, that's what they want you to think, isn't it?New World Order Bible Prophecy [ edit ]When you look into NWO conspiracy theories most, if not all, have Bible-Thumping in it. This comes from a page in the Book of Revelation, stating a New World Order will occur for seven years, and then Jesus returns and defeats the Antichrist, and then we all live happily ever after (except for a brief list of people). So let's say the NWO theory IS right, and it happens. Would it obviously prove the Bible? No. That would be an example of Affirming the consequent. Yes, the Bible states there will be a NWO, but just because one happens does not mean the entire Bible automatically is true. In whole, this is the argument presented by conspiratards:If the Bible is true, then There will be a New World Order.There will be a New World Order.Therefore the Bible is true.This type of argument can be shown as fallacious as using a similar argument:If it is sunny today, I'll get a haircut.I'm going to get a haircut.Therefore, because I'll get a haircut, it is sunny today.The same applies for the Quran Thumpers.David Icke doesn't fall for this argument, which makes most Conspiracy Theorists hate him. Take a guess on how they react.See also [ edit ]Nuevo Orden Mundial es la versin en espaol de este artculo.Si vous voulez cet article en franais, il peut tre trouv  Nouvel Ordre Mondial.Parodies [ edit ]The Beaver MilitiaYahoo Answers - Yes, Virginia there is a New World OrderUncyclopedia's parody of the New World Order.References [ edit ]",New World Order,,,context,irrelevant,irrelevant,,68,fy

We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time theres been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern, said Dr. Polowotski. Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it, said Bob. We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think, he said.

Arctic sea ice is a proxy for global warming and arctic amplification, while the Antarctic behaves more randomly and is lost mostly by El Nino, and is actually predicted to gain by global warming due to increased meltwater discharge from Antarctic glaciers. So bunching them together is not so much good science in my opinion, and was mostly done by deniers claiming there was no problem with sea ice while ignoring the fundamentals.Not intending to criticize, as this chart is very interesting, just reminding folks about the meaning of it.the global sea ice represents very well the state of the global climate, in the long run a warmer climate will lead to less to zero ice ( around the year ) and a cooler climate will lead to an ice age with a third of the planet covered by ice. in this context it think that global sea-ice is indeed the right long-term indicator when it comes to the state of the planet and the differences you mentioned are more of a different way how that shows short term.the reason why i predicted for years that there will be a mid-long-term turnaround in the antarctic as well is simply due to the fact that if the planet will be 5C warmer there will be no more sea ice in summer on both sides and once the land ice masses will be heavily reduced, also on both ends, even though that may take centuries if not millenia to get down to zero or close to zero as it has been in the past and who knows what kind of events will happen in the mean time.i say global sea-ice VOLUME is the ultimate way to measure what's happening long term, short term outliers to both sides on both ends are hype and have to be interpreted with care.again this is more as an add on to your post because as i know form many of your posts i agree to your general way to see things and very much appreciate your well founded contributions :-)cheers",2016 sea ice area and extent data,,,right,context,context,,74,fy

A military strike designed not to defeat an enemy, or take territory, or achieve any kind of tangible political goal, but rather to make a showy statement about our presumed moral decency. A violent tweet. The military wing of gesture politics. The pursuit of PR by other means. And if virtue-signalling is annoying and often authoritarian, with its reduction of every debate to a showdown between the self-obsessed and its green-lighting of Twittermobs against those who dissent from that days virtuous orthodoxy, virtue-bombing is positively lethal. Its treatment of complex conflicts as matters of good and evil, as black-and-white tableaux in which there are evildoers and evil-sufferers and nothing in between, infantilises international affairs and paves the way for action driven more by the virtuous kneejerk than by clear, cool, realpolitik considerations.The American, British and French assault on targets in Damascus at the weekend is an example of virtue-bombing. spiked is not a pacifist publication, but it is very clear to us that this is an act of war unanchored from geopolitical reason and ungoverned by the very basics of political judgement. This joint intervention will do nothing to help the people of Syria and in fact could make their terrible lot worse. As even some in the pro-bombing camp recognise, taking out a few alleged chemical-weapons facilities will not stem the bloodshed in a war in which the vast majority of people are killed by conventional means. And as they occasionally confess, weakening one alleged part of the Assad regimes military apparatus will do nothing to dent the Assad-Russia-Iran alliance to win back Syrian territory from the various opposition forces, some of whom are disturbingly backward movements given to beheading dissidents, obliterating womens liberty, and enforcing 7th-century diktats. In fact it could end up strengthening that alliance, through escalating the ante so that this alliance is now not only concerned with defending Assads authority over Syria, but also with defending its own global and domestic reputations against a new militaristic alliance of Western powers.And strikingly, the virtue-bombing will also bring no benefit to its own authors. It is likely to be detrimental to their geopolitical and domestic interests. The first thing it will do is draw Britain and the US into a needless, further heated confrontation with Russia, risking paralysis, tension and even conflict between the West and the East of the kind we havent seen for many years. That some in the West will get to wrap themselves in the comfort blanket of the old Cold Wars binary global moralism  which seems seriously to be one of the aims of our political elites insatiable urge to bait the Russian bear in recent years  is likely to prove a short-lived high in a world that will become more fissured and tense as a consequence of the foreign-policy establishments reckless global behaviour. And the second thing it will do is boost the very species of Islamist extremism that has in recent years declared existential war upon the West and which in Europe has massacred almost 500 people in the past five years alone. Such groups, rife in the vortex that Syria has become, will benefit directly from the Western alliances actions.This is perhaps the most shocking element of the strikes on Damascus: they make Western powers and their media cheerleaders objectively into the allies of some of the darkest, foulest movements at work in the world today. From ISIS to the Army of Islam to al-Nusra (now Jabhat Fateh al-Sham), the movements lined up against Assad are far from the rebels some Western media coverage would have us believe. They are ruthless religious extremists whose victory in Syria would make the Assad regime, with all its authoritarianism and anti-democracy, look like a pleasant memory in comparison. These groups have enforced terrible rule in places like Raqqa, Ghouta and East Aleppo and have committed barbarous crimes against civilians, including, it is widely suspected, with their own use of chemical weapons. These outfits will welcome the Western alliances actions and will see the Wests heaped pressure on Assad as a green light to their own violent ideological push against the regime. These air strikes are in essence a military wing of Islamist extremism, providing military cover and even moral rejuvenation to an anti-Assad movement that has virtually no positive qualities.",The Wests virtue-bombing of Syria is a disastrous mistake,,Ieuan Joy,context,context,irrelevant,,76,yj

""It was a very, very tight margin.""The decision to delay the vote marks an acute embarrassment for the President, who had gambled big by presenting holdout House conservatives with a take-it-or-leave it ultimatum Thursday night and put his own credibility on the line.But Trump repeatedly pointed the finger directly at Democrats, who all opposed the measure, rather than at his own party, which holds a significant majority in the House.""We had no Democratic support,"" he said. ""I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode. It's exploding right now.""Trump reiterated the point in a tweet Saturday morning, saying, ""Obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!""ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017The failure of the GOP plan also puts Ryan in a much weakened political position, after being defied by his own conference, which seems just as unsuited to governing in the Trump era as it was when it was effectively a protest coalition under Obama.It became clear during a day of intense political intrigue that despite fierce arm-twisting by Trump, Ryan and other leaders that the votes simply were not there to pass the bill and the leadership and the White House were headed for a lopsided defeat.They were unable to narrow the schism between Freedom Caucus conservatives, who believe the bill keeps too much of Obamacare intact, and moderates who worry they will pay an electoral price if millions of Americans lose health insurance.The House meltdown on Obamacare repeal has perilous implications for the American health care system, with Republicans apparently unable to repeal the law but also unwilling to fix the deficiencies that the White House says will collapse the law.""We came up short,"" Ryan told reporters. ""We are going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.""Democrats were gleeful after the failure to even hold a vote.""In my life, I have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the White House today,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who spars often with Trump. ""Today we've learned they can't count votes and they can't close a deal. So much for the art of the deal.""What happens for Trump and Ryan?Politically, Friday's momentous events will race like wildfire through the Republican Party's conservative, establishment base, which has been told repeatedly by candidates that the first order of business with the GOP President in the White House would be to repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Ryan told fellow Republicans they are ""moving on"" from health care, Reps. Andy Barr, R-Kentucky, and Bill Flores, R-Texas, told CNN. Trump said tax reform would be next.Trump, the businessman who touted his ability to get things done and promised to transcend Washington politics, said he's learned from the experience""This was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot,"" he said in the Oval Office. ""We learned a lot about loyalty and we learned a lot about the vote getting process. And we learned about very arcane rules in both the Senate and the House.""Certainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it'll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan,"" he added.The White House maintained after the scrapped vote that it is confident in Ryan.""I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,"" Trump said.White House press secretary Sean Spicer said before the vote Trump has ""left everything on the field when it comes to this bill.""But Republicans had few firm commitments from conservatives and watched a continued exodus of moderates. This was exactly what House leadership was worried would happen when they changed the bill, the source said.But tax reform will be no simpler.Trump acknowledged there are many different groups in the GOP, meaning things aren't as simple as having one party control both the White House, House and Senate.""Lots of different groups. Lots of factions and there's been a long history of liking and disliking within the Republican Party long before I got here,"" he said.Freedom Caucus held outMost prominent of those factions, the Freedom Caucus, held out until the end, saying the bill didn't go enough to repeal Obamacare.Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, said he still wants to work to repeal Obamacare.""I promised the people of North Carolina's 11th District that I would fight for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement with a market-driven approach that brings down costs and provides more choices for the American people,"" Meadows said in a statement.Vice President Mike Pence met Friday afternoon with members of the Freedom Caucus at the Capitol Hill Club, a source familiar with the meeting said.There are clear signs of frustration in the White House at the Freedom Caucus, which has won a series of concession but is still holding out against the bill.""We've emboldened them,"" one White House aide said.Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, said that without a doubt, the decision to concede the repeal of essential health benefits to the Freedom Caucus definitely moved some of his colleagues to ""no.""""I suspect some became a no because of that,"" Lance said. ""That certainly didn't help.""What was in the billThe GOP health care bill would eliminate many of the taxes and eradicate the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan provides Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance.The bill also significantly curtails federal support for Medicaid and allows states to require able-bodied adults to work.

Subfamily: SerrasalminaeDistributionNative to the Rio Orinoco and Amazon basins in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. Introduced populations are thriving in various parts of the world, mainly in Far Eastern countries such as China and Taiwan where its farmed for eating.HabitatInhabits main river channels and flood plains, moving into flooded forests during the rainy season. It tends to prefer shallow, slow-moving areas with overhanging or floating vegetation. Juveniles spend the first few months of life in the flood plains, where food is plentiful and predation is less of a danger.Maximum Standard LengthThe biggest wild fish recorded measured 35.2 (88cm). Captive specimens tend to be a bit smaller than this, but expect it to reach at least 24 (60cm).Aquarium SizeTop Sadly adults are all too often seen living in cramped conditions. If you want to house one of these for life youre going to need an enormous tank measuring at least 120 x 36 x 36 (300cm x 90cm x 90cm)  2550 litres, preferably larger. Youngsters can be grown on in smaller tanks but will grow quickly when well-fed.MaintenanceThe size of the tank and filtration used are much more important than the choice of decor. Strictly speaking, decor isnt necessary for a tank containing an adult as its a very active species. At any rate try not to clutter up the tank space too much. Theres also little point adding plants as theyll be eaten immediately. Opt for a few water-worn boulders and perhaps some large chunks of driftwood or beech branches. Ensure that any such furnishings are too heavy to be moved around or secured to the tank in some way.A large and efficient biological filter is needed to cope with the amounts of waste produced by a fish of this size. If possible choose a sumptype arrangement, as this allows most of the equipment to be located outside the tank. A large specimen can easily destroy glass heaterstats, thermometers etc. as it charges around. Otherwise, buy the biggest filter you can afford (pond filters are worth considering) and perform regular large water changes.Water ConditionsTemperature: 73 to 82F (23 to 28C)pH: It's an adaptable species provided extremes are avoided. Somewhere within the range 4.8 to 7.5 is ok.Hardness: 0 to 15HDietStomach analyses of wild specimens show it to be primarily a herbivorous species, feeding on fruits, nuts and seeds. It is an opportunist, though, and also takes insects, zooplankton and small fish. In the aquarium offer it a varied diet consisting of quality dried pellets or floating sticks, along with plenty of fruit and vegetables. Spinach, lettuce leaves, and fruit and vegetables such as apple, banana, peach, grapes, courgette, peas, cabbage and carrot all work well.Behaviour and CompatibilityTop Small fish will likely be eaten but in general its quite peaceful with bigger species. It can bother sedentary or shy companions with its constant activity, though. Obviously a truly enormous tank is needed to incorporate it into a community. If this kind of space is available suitable tankmates include Arowana, other similarly-sized characins, big cichlids, and large catfish from the Pimelodid, Doradid and Loricariid groups.Its a shoaling species when juvenile, becoming more solitary as it matures. It can be kept in a group in the aquarium, but again, this is largely dependant on the amount of space available. In smaller quarters adults can become a bit of a nuisance, chasing and nipping the fins of both its own kind and other species.Sexual DimorphismMature females are a little rounder-bellied than males.ReproductionNot achieved in the hobby, although its being bred in some numbers for food in both South America and various Far Eastern countries. The fish are often induced to spawn via the use of hormones.Know as the pirapitinga in its native countries, this is the one of the largest species of scaled fish found in the Amazon basin. This alone should tell you much of what you need to know about its suitability as an aquarium inhabitant. In reality its debatable as to whether the species should be considered an aquarium subject at all. While pacu rarely reach their maximum size in captivity, theyre still easily capable of growing to a couple of feet in length. The myth that fish will only grow to match the size of the tank theyre kept in is just that  a myth.Unfortunately its regularly offered for sale as a cute 2-3 fish, often labeled with enticing names such as vegetarian piranha or even red-bellied piranha (pacu are included in the same subfamily as piranha and resemble them superficially). Juveniles of P. brachypomus are in fact patterned to mimic the real red-bellied piranha, Pygocentrus nattereri as a deterrent to potential predators.As a result many public aquaria have large displays of adult specimens that have been donated by fishkeepers, often to the extent where they refuse to accept any more. A more depressing, but equally common scenario is that the fish are dumped into rivers and ponds when they outgrow their tank. In colder climates they will obviously not survive, but populations exist in various states of the USA and several other countries as a result of releases by irresponsible aquarists. The species has subsequently been banned from sale by many wildlife authorities in the US.Pacu have developed amazing dentition to allow them to crush fruit, nuts and seeds. Their teeth are cusped and resemble human molars, and they also have very powerful jaws. Although they are rarely aggressive they can inflict a really nasty bite, so take care when performing tank maintenance.The species is widely used in aquaculture projects in South America. Its ideally suited for the purpose, being tolerant of a wide range of water chemistry and possessing the ability to survive in oxygen-depleted conditions. Much research is being undertaken to find the most ecologically sound way of farming it, as its suffering from gross overfishing in many of its native waters. If wild stocks become further depleted, there could be serious implications not only for the species itself, but also entire ecosystems. The seeds of many of the fruits eaten by pacu are indigestible, and are excreted intact. Some experts believe the fish play a significant role in seed dispersal of plants from areas of flooded forest. Sustainable commercial farming of pacu is therefore considered a priority. Not only will this prevent further depletion of wild stocks, but it will provide an alternative source of income for farmers. The hope is that it may also encourage them to take up aquaculture instead of agriculture, which is having a devastating effect on many parts of the Amazon rainforest.As a food fish pacu is apparently very tasty. Its natural diet of fruit and nuts is said to enhance the flavour of the flesh. As the fish is so large cuts are often sold on the bone in a similar way to pork ribs. One further commercial use of the species is as a sport fish, both in its natural environment and artificially-stocked lakes. Its been introduced into several Far Eastern countries for this purpose, including Thailand and Malaysia.",Piaractus brachypomus (Red-bellied Pacu),,,context,context,context,,92,

Ever since then, the flags have been disappearing, despite the fact that they are part of the history of this great land. And because of that, it seems that the Department of Justice has found a new way to determine who is racist and who isnt.Two men were arrested for beating up an African American man and charged with a hate crime. Going through their Facebook feed, it is pretty easy to see how they are racist. They had pictures of Adolf Hitler, the KKK, and other various white power symbols. But the one thing that the DOJ did include that shouldnt be included was pictures of the Confederate Flag.Now yes, these men were absolutely 100% racist. But just because they had a picture of the Confederate flag doesnt mean that. It was the pictures of Hitler and other symbols of white power that indicate they were racist.If the DOJ is going to start using Confederate flags to determine if someone is racist or not, then there is suddenly going to be a lot more racist people. Despite the fact that the flag is of HISTORICAL significance to the nation.Despite what these social justice warriors think, the flag is not a racist symbol anymore. It is literally a historical object. It is also part of this history of this country. So it sounds like they are trying to get rid of all the bad parts of history, despite the fact that its necessary to learn about them.But wouldnt it be interesting if they tried to ban something else from history, like the black panther salute? I really wonder how people would react to that.Share this article if you are among the many that dont consider the Confederate flag a racist symbol.",Loretta Lynch: Confederate Flag Tattoos Must All Be Removed IMMEDIATELY,2008-04-16,Matthew Bernstein,right,right,context,,93,yj

Steve King (R-Iowa) retweeted a British neo-Nazi on Tuesday, the latest in a series of incidents in which the congressman has parroted or promoted the views of unabashed white supremacists and other bigots. Europe is waking up... Will America... in time? King tweeted, linking to an anti-immigrant tweet from political activist Mark Collett. Collett is one of Britains most high-profile white supremacists. He has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has called himself a Nazi sympathizer. Kings office did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday as to whether he condones the views of neo-Nazis, whether hes concerned his views align with those of neo-Nazis or whether a U.S. congressman should be amplifying a neo-Nazi on Twitter. Kings office also did not respond when asked if the congressman considers himself a white nationalist. The tweet, posted early Tuesday morning, hasnt been deleted.Twitter screenshotNo mainstream politician in their right mind should be retweeting Mark Collett, said Nick Ryan, director of communications at the British-based anti-racism advocacy group Hope Not Hate. Hes a neo-Nazi who used to be the youth leader of the thuggish far-right British National Party here in the U.K., which has had ties to Holocaust denial, rampant anti-Semitism, helped spawn one of Europes most infamous neo-Nazi gangs, Combat 18, and which once included among its number David Copeland, a bomber who targeted Londons minority communities with a series of nail bombs in 1999, killing three, including a pregnant woman, and wounding scores of others, Ryan said. Collett was the subject of a 2002 Channel 4 documentary in the United Kingdom called Young, Nazi and Proud, in which he states that AIDS is a friendly disease because blacks, drug users and gays have it. The Jews have been thrown out of every country, including England, he says in the documentary. Lets face it, when it happens that many times its not just persecution: theres no smoke without fire. More recently, as documented on the blog Angry White Men, Collett has been a frequent guest on white nationalist or alt-right podcasts. Just last month, he co-hosted an episode of This Week on the Alt-Right. The episodes special guest was American white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke, whom Collett praised. If he has any sense, Steve King should rapidly hit the undo button [on Twitter], Ryan, the Hope Not Hate spokesperson, said of Kings tweet Tuesday.

His works have been translated into many languages, and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century for nearly 200 films. Dumas' last novel, The Knight of Sainte-Hermine, unfinished at his death, was completed by scholar Claude Schopp and published in 2005.[2] It was published in English in 2008 as The Last Cavalier.Prolific in several genres, Dumas began his career by writing plays, which were successfully produced from the first. He also wrote numerous magazine articles and travel books; his published works totalled 100,000 pages.[3] In the 1840s, Dumas founded the Thtre Historique in Paris.His father, General Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie, was born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) to Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman, and Marie-Cessette Dumas, a slave of African descent.[4] At age 14 Thomas-Alexandre was taken by his father to France, where he was educated in a military academy and entered the military for what became an illustrious career.Dumas' father's aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre acquire work with Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orlans. He later began working as a writer, finding early success. Decades later, in the election of Louis-Napolon Bonaparte in 1851, Dumas fell from favour and left France for Belgium, where he stayed for several years. Upon leaving Belgium, Dumas moved to Russia for a few years before going to Italy. In 1861, he founded and published the newspaper L'Indipendente, which supported the Italian unification effort. In 1864, he returned to Paris.Though married, in the tradition of Frenchmen of higher social class, Dumas had numerous affairs (allegedly as many as forty). In his lifetime, he was known to have at least four illegitimate children; although twentieth-century scholars found that Dumas fathered another three other children out of wedlock. He acknowledged and assisted his son, Alexandre Dumas, to become a successful novelist and playwright. They are known as Alexandre Dumas pre ('father') and Alexandre Dumas fils ('son'). Among his affairs, in 1866, Dumas had one with Adah Isaacs Menken, an American actress then less than half his age and at the height of her career.The English playwright Watts Phillips, who knew Dumas in his later life, described him as ""the most generous, large-hearted being in the world. He also was the most delightfully amusing and egotistical creature on the face of the earth. His tongue was like a windmill  once set in motion, you never knew when he would stop, especially if the theme was himself.""[5]Early life [ edit ]Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie (later known as Alexandre Dumas) was born in 1802 in Villers-Cotterts in the department of Aisne, in Picardy, France. He had two older sisters, Marie-Alexandrine (born 1794) and Louise-Alexandrine (born 1796, died 1797).[6] Their parents were Marie-Louise lisabeth Labouret, the daughter of an innkeeper, and Thomas-Alexandre Dumas.Thomas-Alexandre had been born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), the mixed-race, natural son of the marquis Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman and gnral commissaire in the artillery of the colony, and Marie-Cessette Dumas, a slave of Afro-Caribbean ancestry. At the time of Thomas-Alexandre's birth, his father was impoverished. It is not known whether his mother was born in Saint-Domingue or in Africa, nor is it known from which African people her ancestors came.[7][8][9]Brought as a boy to France by his father and legally freed there, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy was educated in a military school and joined the army as a young man. As an adult, Thomas-Alexandre used his mother's name, Dumas, as his surname after a break with his father. Dumas was promoted to general by the age of 31, the first soldier of Afro-Antilles origin to reach that rank in the French army.[10] He served with distinction in the French Revolutionary Wars. He became general-in-chief of the Army of the Pyrenees, the first man of colour to reach that rank. Although a general under Bonaparte in the Italian and Egyptian campaigns, Dumas had fallen out of favour by 1800 and requested leave to return to France. On his return, his ship had to put in at Taranto in the Kingdom of Naples, where he and others were held as prisoners of war.In 1806, when Alexandre was four years of age, his father, Thomas-Alexandre, died of cancer. His widowed mother, Marie-Louise, could not provide her son with much of an education, but Dumas read everything he could and taught himself Spanish. Although poor, the family had their father's distinguished reputation and aristocratic rank to aid the children's advancement. In 1822, after the restoration of the monarchy, the 20-year-old Alexandre Dumas moved to Paris. He acquired a position at the Palais Royal in the office of Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orlans.[citation needed]Career [ edit ]While working for Louis-Philippe, Dumas began writing articles for magazines and plays for the theatre. As an adult, he used his slave grandmother's surname of Dumas, as his father had done as an adult.[11] His first play, Henry III and His Courts, produced in 1829 when he was 27 years old, met with acclaim. The next year, his second play, Christine, was equally popular. These successes gave him sufficient income to write full-time.In 1830, Dumas participated in the Revolution that ousted Charles X and replaced him with Dumas' former employer, the Duke of Orlans, who ruled as Louis-Philippe, the Citizen King. Until the mid-1830s, life in France remained unsettled, with sporadic riots by disgruntled Republicans and impoverished urban workers seeking change. As life slowly returned to normal, the nation began to industrialise. An improving economy combined with the end of press censorship made the times rewarding for Alexandre Dumas' literary skills.After writing additional successful plays, Dumas switched to writing novels. Although attracted to an extravagant lifestyle and always spending more than he earned, Dumas proved to be an astute marketer.[4] As newspapers were publishing many serial novels, in 1838, Dumas rewrote one of his plays as his first serial novel, Le Capitaine Paul. He founded a production studio, staffed with writers who turned out hundreds of stories, all subject to his personal direction, editing, and additions.From 1839 to 1841, Dumas, with the assistance of several friends, compiled Celebrated Crimes, an eight-volume collection of essays on famous criminals and crimes from European history. He featured Beatrice Cenci, Martin Guerre, Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, as well as more recent events and criminals, including the cases of the alleged murderers Karl Ludwig Sand and Antoine Franois Desrues, who were executed.Dumas collaborated with Augustin Grisier, his fencing master, in his 1840 novel, The Fencing Master. The story is written as Grisier's account of how he came to witness the events of the Decembrist revolt in Russia. The novel was eventually banned in Russia by Czar Nicholas I, and Dumas was prohibited from visiting the country until after the Czar's death. Dumas refers to Grisier with great respect in The Count of Monte Cristo, The Corsican Brothers, and in his memoirs.Dumas depended on numerous assistants and collaborators, of whom Auguste Maquet was the best known. It was not until the late twentieth century that his role was fully understood.[12] Dumas wrote the short novel Georges (1843), which uses ideas and plots later repeated in The Count of Monte Cristo. Maquet took Dumas to court to try to get authorial recognition and a higher rate of payment for his work. He was successful in getting more money, but not a by-line.[12][13]Dumas' novels were so popular that they were soon translated into English and other languages. His writing earned him a great deal of money, but he was frequently insolvent, as he spent lavishly on women and sumptuous living. (Scholars have found that he had a total of 40 mistresses.[14]) In 1846, he had built a country house outside Paris at Le Port-Marly, the large Chteau de Monte-Cristo, with an additional building for his writing studio. It was often filled with strangers and acquaintances who stayed for lengthy visits and took advantage of his generosity. Two years later, faced with financial difficulties, he sold the entire property.Dumas wrote in a wide variety of genres and published a total of 100,000 pages in his lifetime.[3] He also made use of his experience, writing travel books after taking journeys, including those motivated by reasons other than pleasure. Dumas traveled to Spain, Italy, Germany, England and French Algeria. After King Louis-Philippe was ousted in a revolt, Louis-Napolon Bonaparte was elected president. As Bonaparte disapproved of the author, Dumas fled in 1851 to Brussels, Belgium, which was also an effort to escape his creditors. About 1859, he moved to Russia, where French was the second language of the elite and his writings were enormously popular. Dumas spent two years in Russia and visited St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Astrakhan and Tbilisi, before leaving to seek different adventures. He published travel books about Russia.In March 1861, the kingdom of Italy was proclaimed, with Victor Emmanuel II as its king. Dumas travelled there and for the next three years participated in the movement for Italian unification. He founded and led a newspaper, Indipendente. Returning to Paris in 1864, he published travel books about Italy.Despite Dumas' aristocratic background and personal success, he had to deal with discrimination related to his mixed-race ancestry. In 1843, he wrote a short novel, Georges, that addressed some of the issues of race and the effects of colonialism. His response to a man who insulted him about his African ancestry has become famous. Dumas said:My father was a mulatto, my grandfather was a Negro, and my great-grandfather a monkey. You see, Sir, my family starts where yours ends.[15][16]Personal life [ edit ]On 1 February 1840, Dumas married actress Ida Ferrier (born Marguerite-Josphine Ferrand) (18111859).[17] He had numerous liaisons with other women and was known to have fathered at least four children by them:Alexandre Dumas, fils (18241895), son of Marie-Laure-Catherine Labay (17941868), a dressmaker. He became a successful novelist and playwright.(18241895), son of Marie-Laure-Catherine Labay (17941868), a dressmaker. He became a successful novelist and playwright.

She had performed her sensational role in Mazeppa in London. In Paris, she had a sold-out run of Les Pirates de la Savanne and was at the peak of her success.[18]These women were among Dumas' nearly 40 mistresses found by scholar Claude Schopp, in addition to three natural children.[14]Death and legacy [ edit ]Dumas later in his careerAt his death in December 1870, Dumas was buried at his birthplace of Villers-Cotterts in the department of Aisne. His death was overshadowed by the Franco-Prussian War. Changing literary fashions decreased his popularity. In the late twentieth century, scholars such as Reginald Hamel and Claude Schopp have caused a critical reappraisal and new appreciation of his art, as well as finding lost works.[3]In 1970, the Alexandre Dumas Paris Mtro station was named in his honour. His country home outside Paris, the Chteau de Monte-Cristo, has been restored and is open to the public as a museum.[citation needed]Researchers have continued to find Dumas works in archives, including the five-act play, The Gold Thieves, found in 2002 by the scholar Rginald Hamel (fr) in the Bibliothque Nationale de France. It was published in France in 2004 by Honor-Champion.[3]Postal stamp of Georgia . Dumas visited the Caucasus in 1858-1859Frank Wild Reed (18741953), the older brother of Dunedin publisher A. H. Reed, was a busy Whangarei pharmacist who never visited France, yet he amassed the greatest collection of books and manuscripts relating to Dumas outside France. It contains about 3350 volumes, including some 2000 sheets in Dumas' handwriting and dozens of French, Belgian and English first editions. This collection was donated to Auckland Libraries after his death.[19] Reed wrote the most comprehensive bibliography of Dumas.[20][21]In 2002, for the bicentennial of Dumas' birth, French President Jacques Chirac had a ceremony honouring the author by having his ashes re-interred at the mausoleum of the Panthon of Paris, where many French luminaries were buried.[3][14] The proceedings were televised: the new coffin was draped in a blue velvet cloth and carried on a caisson flanked by four mounted Republican Guards costumed as the four Musketeers. It was transported through Paris to the Panthon.[11] In his speech, President Chirac said:""With you, we were D'Artagnan, Monte Cristo, or Balsamo, riding along the roads of France, touring battlefields, visiting palaces and castleswith you, we dream.""[22]Chirac acknowledged the racism that had existed in France and said that the re-interment in the Pantheon had been a way of correcting that wrong, as Alexandre Dumas was enshrined alongside fellow great authors Victor Hugo and mile Zola.[22][23] Chirac noted that although France has produced many great writers, none has been so widely read as Dumas. His novels have been translated into nearly 100 languages. In addition, they have inspired more than 200 motion pictures.Tomb of Alexandre Dumas at the Panthon in ParisIn June 2005, Dumas' last novel, The Knight of Sainte-Hermine, was published in France featuring the Battle of Trafalgar. Dumas described a fictional character killing Lord Nelson (Nelson was shot and killed by an unknown sniper). Writing and publishing the novel serially in 1869, Dumas had nearly finished it before his death. It was the third part of the Sainte-Hermine trilogy.Claude Schopp, a Dumas scholar, noticed a letter in an archive in 1990 that led him to discover the unfinished work. It took him years to research it, edit the completed portions, and decide how to treat the unfinished part. Schopp finally wrote the final two-and-a-half chapters, based on the author's notes, to complete the story.[14] Published by ditions Phbus, it sold 60,000 copies, making it a best seller. Translated into English, it was released in 2006 as The Last Cavalier, and has been translated into other languages.[14]Schopp has since found additional material related to the Saints-Hermine saga. Schopp combined them to publish the sequel Le Salut de l'Empire in 2008.[14]Dumas is briefly mentioned in the 2012 film Django Unchained. The Southern slaveholder Calvin Candie expressed admiration for Dumas, owning his books in his library and even naming one of his slaves D'Artagnan. He is surprised to learn from another white man that Dumas was black (in actuality, quarter-black).Works [ edit ]Fiction [ edit ]High adventure [ edit ]Alexandre Dumas wrote numerous stories and historical chronicles of high adventure. They included the following:Le Comte de Moret First page of the original manuscript toThe Count of Moret; The Red Sphinx; or, Richelieu and his rivals ( Le Comte de Moret; Le Sphinx Rouge , 18651866)( , 18651866) The Prince of Thieves ( Le Prince des voleurs , 1872, posthumously).

(A third sequel, The Son of Porthos, 1883 (a.k.a. The Death of Aramis) was published under the name of Alexandre Dumas; however, the real author was Paul Mahalin.)The Valois romances [ edit ]The Valois were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589, so, many of Dumas romances cover their reign. Traditionally, the so-called ""Valois Romances"" are the three that portray the Reign of Queen Marguerite, the last of the Valois:Dumas, however, wrote four more novels that cover this family and portray similar characters, starting with Franois or Francis I, his son Henry II, and Marguerite and Franois II, sons of Henry II and Catherine de' Medici.Ascanio (novel) (1843); Written in collaboration with Paul Meurice.

The Horoscope: a romance of the reign of Franois II (1858), covers Franois II, who reigned one year (15591560) and died at the age of 16.The Marie Antoinette romances [ edit ]The Marie Antoinette romances comprise eight novels. The unabridged versions (normally 100 chapters or more) comprise only five books (numbers 1,3,4,7 and 8); the short versions (50 chapters or less) number eight in total:Joseph Balsamo (Mmoires d'un mdecin: Joseph Balsamo, 18461848) (a.k.a. Memoirs of a Physician, Cagliostro, Madame Dubarry, The Countess Dubarry, or The Elixir of Life)(Joseph Balsamo is about 1000 pages long, and is usually published in two volumes in English translations: Vol 1. Joseph Balsamo and Vol 2. Memoirs of a Physician.) The long unabridged version includes the contents of book two, Andre de Taverney; the short abridged versions usually are divided in ""Balsamo"" and ""Andre de Taverney"" as completely different books. Andre de Taverney, or The Mesmerist's Victim The Queen's Necklace (Le Collier de la Reine, 1849(1850) Ange Pitou (1853) (a.k.a. Storming the Bastille or Six Years Later).

The Hero of the People The Royal Life Guard or The Flight of the Royal Family. The Countess de Charny (La Comtesse de Charny, 18531855). Same situation as with the other books, there are long unabridged versions which include the contents of book six; but many short versions that leave contents in ""The Royal Life Guard"" as a separated volume. Le Chevalier de Maison-Rouge (1845) (a.k.a. The Knight of the Red House, or The Knight of Maison-Rouge)The Sainte-Hermine trilogy [ edit ]Drama [ edit ]Although best known now as a novelist, Dumas first earned fame as a dramatist. His Henri III et sa cour (1829) was the first of the great Romantic historical dramas produced on the Paris stage, preceding Victor Hugo's more famous Hernani (1830). Produced at the Comdie-Franaise and starring the famous Mademoiselle Mars, Dumas' play was an enormous success and launched him on his career. It had fifty performances over the next year, extraordinary at the time.Other hits followed.Antony (1831)-a drama with a contemporary Byronic hero-is considered the first non-historical Romantic drama. It starred Mars' great rival Marie Dorval.(1831)-a drama with a contemporary Byronic hero-is considered the first non-historical Romantic drama. It starred Mars' great rival Marie Dorval.

It was discovered in 2002 by the Canadian scholar Reginald Hamel, who was researching in the Bibliothque Nationale de France. The play was published in France in 2004 by Honor-Champion. Hamel said that Dumas was inspired by a novel written in 1857 by his mistress Clste de Mogador.[3]Dumas wrote many plays and adapted several of his novels as dramas. In the 1840s, he founded the Thtre Historique, located on the Boulevard du Temple in Paris. The building was used after 1852 by the Opra National (established by Adolphe Adam in 1847). It was renamed the Thtre Lyrique in 1851.Nonfiction [ edit ]Dumas was a prolific writer of nonfiction. He wrote journal articles on politics and culture and books on French history.His lengthy Grand Dictionnaire de cuisine (Great Dictionary of Cuisine) was published posthumously in 1873. A combination of encyclopaedia and cookbook, it reflects Dumas' interests as both a gourmet and an expert cook. An abridged version (the Petit Dictionnaire de cuisine, or Small Dictionary of Cuisine) was published in 1883.He was also known for his travel writing. These books included:Impressions de voyage: En Suisse ( Travel Impressions: In Switzerland , 1834)( , 1834) Une Anne  Florence ( A Year in Florence , 1841)( , 1841) De Paris  Cadix ( From Paris to Cadiz , 1847)( , 1847) Montevideo, ou une nouvelle Troie , 1850 ( The New Troy ), inspired by the Great Siege of Montevideo, 1850 ( ), inspired by the Great Siege of Montevideo Le Journal de Madame Giovanni ( The Journal of Madame Giovanni , 1856)( , 1856) Travel Impressions in the Kingdom of Napoli/Naples Trilogy :: Impressions of Travel in Sicily ( Le Speronare (Sicily  1835) , 1842( , 1842 Captain Arena ( Le Capitaine Arena (Italy  Aeolian Islands and Calabria  1835) , 1842( , 1842 Impressions of Travel in Naples ( Le Corricolo (Rome  Naples  1833) , 1843( , 1843 Travel Impressions in Russia  Le Caucase Original edition: Paris 1859Adventures in Czarist Russia, or From Paris to Astrakhan ( Impressions de voyage: En Russie; De Paris  Astrakan: Nouvelles impressions de voyage (1858) , 18591862( , 18591862 Voyage to the Caucasus ( Le Caucase: Impressions de voyage; suite de En Russie (1859) , 18581859( , 18581859 The Bourbons of Naples (Italian: I Borboni di Napoli , 1862) (7 volumes published by Italian newspaper L'Indipendente, whose director was Dumas himself).[25][26]Dumas Society [ edit ]French historian Alain Decaux founded the ""Socit des Amis d'Alexandre Dumas"" (The Society of Friends of Alexandre Dumas) in 1971. The purpose in creating this society was to preserve the Chteau de Monte-Cristo, where the society is currently located. The other objectives of the Society is to bring together fans of Dumas, to proceed cultural activities of the Chteau de Monte-Cristo, and to collect book manuscripts, autographs and other materials on Dumas.

The devices would allow the troops to run faster, jump higher and lift weights beyond human capacity.I think in about five years we will have a neuro-interface to control exoskeletons and prosthetics through the brains electric impulses, Aleksandr Kulish, the head of the medical equipment development and manufacturing department of Russias United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation, told TASS news agency.The new system could increase the wearers strength and endurance manyfold, allowing soldiers to make tremendous leaps, lift and throw objects they normally could not, as well as carrying up to 300 kilograms of equipment.An exoskeleton is essentially a wearable robot, an external skeleton-like structure that follows the shape of the wearer's body and partially encases it. It has joints and other mechanisms allowing it to repeat and strengthen the body's natural movements.READ MORE: Russian start-up to clinically test first human exoskeletonThe current neuro-interface allows for the control of an exoskeleton through visual images, says Aleksandr Kulish: For example, a person imagines a black square, and the [exoskeleton's] hand unclenches, and if they imagine a red square, it clenches.Exoskeletons are being developed worldwide. Apart from military use, they could have numerous civilian implementations. Medical skeletons could assist the movement of injured, disabled, or overtly obese patients, while construction workers could benefit from the ability to lift greater loads.The idea of the exoskeleton is borrowed from nature: Insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates use hard external casings to support and protect themselves, although in their cases, the shell covers all or most of the body.",Iron Man mass-production?

FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bob-marley-cia/,Did a CIA Agent Confess to Killing Bob Marley?,Fake News,04-Dec-17,"A former CIA agent named ""Bill Oxley"" confessed on his death bed to killing Bob Marley.",https://web.archive.org/web/20171201183322/http://yournewswire.com/cia-agent-deathbed-bob-marley/,1,FALSE,No Error,"A 79-year-old retired officer of the CIA, Bill Oxley, has made a series of stunning confessions since he was admitted to the Mercy Hospital in Maine on Monday and told he has weeks to live. He claims he committed 17 assassinations for the American government between 1974 and 1985, including the music icon Bob Marley.Mr. Oxley, who worked for the CIA for 29 years as an operative with top-level security clearances, claims he was often used as a hitman by the organization, to assassinate individuals who could represent a threat to the goals of the agency.Trained as a sniper and marksman, Mr. Oxley also has significant experience with more unconventional methods of inflicting harm upon others, like poisons, explosives, induced heart attacks and cancer.The 79-year-old operative claims he committed the assassinations between March 1974 and August 1985, at a time when he says the CIA was a law unto itself. He says he was part of an operative cell of three members which carried out political assassinations across the country and occasionally in foreign countries.Most of their victims were political activists, journalists, and union leaders, but he also confesses to assassinating a few scientists, medical researchers, artists and musicians whose ideas and influence represented a threat to the interests of the United States.He claims he had no problem with going through with the assassination of Bob Marley, because I was a patriot, I believed in the CIA, and I didnt question the motivation of the agency. Ive always understood that sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.But Mr. Oxley confesses that Bob Marley remains unique among his victims, as he was the only victim he felt anything for.The others were assholes. Bob Marley was Bob Marley. I was no closer to being a long-haired hippy back then than I am now, but I must admit Bobs music did move me. It held some power over me.He claims to have mixed feelings about Bob Marleys death. On the one hand, Marley was a good man, a beautiful soul with profound artistic gifts who did not deserve to have his life cut short. But according to Mr. Oxley, Bob Marley was also placing the goals of the CIA in jeopardy and threatening the existence of the United States:He was succeeding in creating a revolution that used music as a more powerful tool than bullets and bombs. Bob Marley in 1976 was a very serious threat to the global status quo and to the hidden power brokers implementing their plan for a new world order. As far as the agency was concerned, Bob Marley was too successful, too famous, too influential A Jamaican Rastaman who started using his funds and fame to support causes around the world that were in direct conflict with the CIA To be honest, he signed his own death warrant.Its not like we didnt warn him. We sent a few guys to shoot up his house in Kingston, Mr Oxley says, referring to a shooting in the Marley residence that left the singer with an injured arm and chest. We had a message for him. We impressed upon him the gravity of the situation he found himself in. He didnt listen.Two days later, in the mountains, I stuck him with the pin.How Bob Marley was murdered by the CIATwo days after Bob Marley was shot in the left arm by one of three gunmen who ambushed the singer and some of his crew in his house in Kingston, and after a brief stint in hospital, Bob Marley travelled to the protective hills of the Blue Mountains and spent time at the highest point in Jamaica, rehearsing for an upcoming concert.According to Mr. Oxley, he used press credentials to gain access to Bob Marley during his Blue Mountains retreat. He introduced himself as a famous photographer working for the New York Times, and gave Bob Marley a gift.I gave him a pair of Converse All Stars. Size 10. When he tried on the right shoe, he screamed out OUUUCH.That was it. His life was over right there and then. The nail in the shoe was tainted with cancer viruses and bacteria. If it pierced his skin, which it did, it was goodnight nurse.There had been a series of high-profile assassinations of counter-culture figures in the United States in the late sixties, early seventies. By the time Bob Marleys time came around, we thought subtlety was the order of the day. No more bullets and splattered brains.Mr. Oxley says he kept close contact with Marley during the final years of his life, ensuring the medical advice he received in Paris, London and the United States would hasten his demise rather than cure him. He died from cancer in May 1981. He was just 36 years old.The last time I saw Bob before he died he had removed the dreadlocks, and his weight was dropping like a stone, he says.He was very withdrawn, unbelievably small. He was shrinking in front of us. The cancer had done its job.The day he died in Miami was definitely one of the most difficult moments in my career. I felt real bad. For a long time I wasnt comfortable with my part in his death. But eventually I came to realize it had to be done, for America.",CIA Agent Confesses On Deathbed: I Killed Bob Marley,11/30/17,Kaza Dum,right,right,right,,99,

Vallejo (1808-1890) By Zoeth Skinner Eldredge (1846-1915) Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, born in Monterey July 7, 1808; died in Sonoma January 18, 1890; married in San Diego March 6, 1832, Francisca Benicia Carrillo, one of the most beautiful of the handsome daughters of Don Joaquin Carrillo and Maria Ignaca Lopez his wife.Vallejo entered the military service as cadet of the Monterey company January 8, 1824. He was made Alfrez (ensign) July 30, 1827; lieutenant June 22, 1835; captain July 9, 1838; lieutenant-colonel of cavalry May 2, 1842. In 1838 he was made comandante-general of California; and previous to that had been made comandante militar del Frontera del Norte, with headquarters at Sonoma. A commission as colonel of cavalry was sent him September 9, 1846.The life of young Vallejo at Monterey was not different from other boys of his class. With young Castro, Alvarado, Estrada, and the rest he went to school to the soldier schoolmasters and as he grew older his desire for knowledge craved other works than the lives of the saints and the doctrina Christiana. Governor Sola took much interest in the boys and helped them to obtain a few books of a more secular nature, and as they grew older they made use of their opportunities in procuring from visiting ship-masters such books as could be had which they carefully concealed from the vigilant eyes of the padres ever on guard to confiscate and destroy books of heretical tendency.In 1830 Vallejo was assigned to the San Francisco company of which he was made comandante in 1831. He made several campaigns against the Indians and in 1834 was sent as comisionado to secularize the mission of San Francisco Solano. He was a member of the territorial diputacion in 1827, and for several years thereafter, and in 1834 was granted the Petaluma rancho.In 1835 Vallejo was instructed to lay out a pueblo at the Solano mission, was made director of colonization at the north and was authorized to issue grants of land to settlers; the scheme being to prevent, by Spanish colonization, further extension of the Russian establishment of Ross. Vallejo laid out the pueblo and gave it the Indian name of the valley, SonomaValley of the Moon. He labored very earnestly to establish his pueblo and succeeded in attracting a number of families to it. He transferred the San Francisco company to Sonoma and also organized a company of about fifty Indians whom he drilled in the manual of arms. After the neglect of the Mexican government to pay its soldiers had caused the presidial companies to disband, Vallejo supported his military establishment for several years at his own expense. In 1834 he took the preliminary steps for establishing a civil government at San Francisco and on January 1, 1835, turned over to the ayuntamiento the control of civil affairs of that pueblo. He was untiring in his efforts to settle and develop the northern frontier and through his wise management and influence with the Indian chiefs the peace of the frontier was rarely broken. In the rising of Alvarado and Castro against Gutierrez he took no active part, though his sympathies were with his nephew, Alvarado, and he accepted office under the government formed by him. He was now (1837) the foremost man in California as he was one of the richest. Over the hills of his princely estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to six thousand horses, and many thousand sheep. He occupied a baronial castle on the plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with most royal hospitality and few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had a great ranch house called La Hacienda and on his home farm, Lachryma Montis (Tear of the Mountain), he built, about 1849, a modern frame house where he spent the later years of his life.Vallejos attitude towards the Russians at Fort Ross and Bodega was firm and dignified. He maintained that the Russians were on California soil and he notified the Russian manager, Rotchef, that while the use of the port of Bodega by the Russians was tolerated, if he permitted foreigners to land and enter the country in defiance of law he must not be surprised if he found Mexican troops stationed there.Vallejo also objected to Sutters establishing an independent principality in the Sacramento valley and his assumption of authority to wage war upon the natives, to grant passports, and to exercise other prerogatives of sovereignty. This made Sutter very angry and he announced that if he were interfered with he would not only defend himself but would declare the independence of California from the Mexican rule.We have seen... the ineffectual attempts of Vallejo to revive the military establishment of California. He had cause to be dissatisfied with the administration of Alvarado, who, giving himself up to luxurious ease and dissipation had largely left the management of affairs to the politicians that surrounded him. Juan Bautista Alvarado was a young man of excellent ability, fairly well educated for his time, of handsome person and courteous manners, and of great popularity and influence with all classes. He was born in Monterey February 14, 1809, and was son of Jos Francisco Alvarado and Mara Josefa Vallejo, and his grandfather, Juan Bautista Alvarado, was a soldier of Portols expedition, 1769. Alvarados marriage to Doa Martina Castro, daughter of Francisco Mara Castro, at the mission of Santa Clara August 24, 1839, was a notable event and was attended by all the great in social and political life. Alvarado, who was then governor, was ill at Monterey and was represented by his half-brother, Jos Antonio Estrada, who as his proxy, stood at the altar with the bride. The governor was at this time thirty years of age, and of most distinguished appearance; but already the habit of excessive drinking was upon him and it soon became so confirmed that he was frequently unable, through illness, to perform his official duties.Disappointed in his expectation of reform in the government and in the failure of what he considered necessary measures for the national defence, Vallejo wrote the supreme government in 1841 giving his opinion of Alvarados rule, stating his belief that the country was going to ruin, and asking to be relieved of his command. He recommended that the offices of governor and comandante-general be united in one person. Later in December of that year he pointed out to the minister of war the illness of California and suggested the remedy that should be applied. California as a country was nowhere excelled in natural advantages of climate, soil, and harbors, and it had all the elements of a grand prosperity, needing only an energetic population and wise regulations. The land was capable of every product for the welfare of a happy and prosperous people yet they imported most of the articles they consumed. A man free from ties of relationship with the people should be placed at the head of affairs and invested with both civil and military authority; a force of at least two hundred men should be sent in charge of competent officers; the fort at San Francisco should be rebuilt and, a custom-house established there; a colony of Mexican artisans and farmers should be sent to the country to counterbalance the influx of foreigners; and many other recommendations were made.The result of Vallejos dispatches was the appointment of Micheltorena to the offices of governor and comandante-general. Having been instrumental in bringing Micheltorena into California Vallejo stood his friend and fed his army, and also loaned him several thousand dollars in money. For this assistance Micheltorena, having no funds with which to pay Vallejo, granted him, in June 1844, the Rancho Nacional Soscol, in what is now part of Solano County.In the rising against Micheltorena Vallejo took no part, but he made an indignant protest against Sutters arming foreigners and Indians against his country. He advised Micheltorena that he was well esteemed by the Californians and would be still more highly thought of if he would send his cholos away. He would not take an active part against the governor, but to avoid sending him reinforcements and defend a band of convicts whose presence he deemed a curse to California, he disbanded his Sonoma forces November 28, 1844, and so notified the governor, saying he could no longer support them at his own expense as he had been doing.Always friendly to the immigrants Vallejo exceeded his authority in protecting them, and in this and in openly advocating the cause of the United States, his great influence was always used for the American cause notwithstanding the treatment he received. One can hardly conceive a more ungrateful return for the kindness to immigrants and help to Americans than to be seized and confined in a dismal prison by these same immigrants and kept there long after the United States authorities had taken possession and the United States flag was flying over his prison house. On September 15, 1846, he wrote Larkin: I left the Sacramento half dead and arrived here (Sonoma) almost without life, but am now much better. *** The political change has cost a great deal to my person and mind and likewise to my property. I have lost more than one thousand live horned cattle, six hundred tame horses, and many other things of value which were taken from my house here and at Petaluma., My wheat crops are entirely lost for the cattle ate them up in the field and I assure you that two hundred fanegas [about 25,000 bushels] of sowing, in good condition as mine was is a considerable loss. All is lost and the a only hope for making it up is to work again.That Vallejos services to the American cause were appreciated by some of the officers is shown by a letter from Captain Montgomery of the Portsmouth dated, September 25, 1846. The Captain sends hearty thanks for the service you have rendered as well as for the prompt and sincere manner in which you were pleased to tender your assistance to the government of the United States in the recent emergency, and to your associates whose ready obedience to your call has done much towards allaying natural prejudices and unfriendly suspicions among the various classes comprising the society of California, and for hastening arrangements for the establishment of peace, order, and good government in the country.I quote these letters because they represent the character of the man far better than any words of mine can, and how did the United States requite the services of this man? By passing laws which by their action deprived him of all his property and changed his condition from that of the richest man in California to one of comparative poverty. The land commission confirmed his grant of Rancho Nacional Soscol. The government carried it to the district-court which confirmed the action of the land commission. The government appealed the case to the supreme court which rejected the claim on the ground that the Mexican government gave away its land in California but could not sell government land for food furnished its soldiers. A most astounding decision. In 1863 Congress by special act permitted the holders of Vallejo titles to buy their land at a dollar and a quarter an acre. His great rancho of Petaluma, ten leagues, to which he added five leagues more by purchasesixty-six thousand acresnothing remains but the little home farm and residence, Lachryma Montis. This is the possession and home of his two youngest daughters and the spring which gives it its name supplies the town of Sonoma with water, and the daughters with a small income. The claim to the Petaluma rancho was not confirmed until 1875, after General Vallejo tired of fighting squatters and lawyers had given up his right to the land.On December 22, 1846, Vallejo deeded to Robert Semple an undivided half of a tract of five square miles of the Soscol rancho, on the straits of Carquines, for a new city to be built which was to be the great seaport and commercial city of the bay of San Francisco. The town was to be, named Francisca, in honor of Vallejos wife, Doa Francisca Benicia Carrillo. Thomas O. Larkin became interested in the venture and took over the greater part of Vallejos interest. The attempt to appropriate the name as well as the commercial supremacy of San Francisco was frustrated by an order of Alcalde Washington A. Bartlett requiring the name San Francisco substituted for Yerba Buena on all public documents. Doctor Semple was very indignant at this action and spluttered over it in the Californian which he had removed from Monterey to San Francisco. To prevent confusion the name of Francisca was changed to Benicia, the second name of Seora Vallejo. The site for the city was a beautiful one, but trade did not leave San Francisco, though General Persifer F. Smith removed the army headquarters to the city on the strait. The attempt was made to have Benicia named capital of California and General Vallejo made most generous offers to the legislature of land and money if they would move the capital thither.Vallejo was a member of the constitutional convention and he applied himself to the work of creating a state with energy and diligence. In common with the other Californians in the convention he endeavored to protect the interests of the natives of the country. The seal of California caused much discussion. Major R. S. Garnett made a design which was accepted, but the members insisted upon the addition of various features. At last when all was agreed the bear emblem was brought forward. Some of the California members were very angry and protested against the bear being used. General Vallejo said that if the bear was put on the seal it should be represented as under the control of a vaquero with a lasso around its neck.Bayard Taylor says, writing of the convention:One of the most intelligent and influential of the Californians is General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, whom I had the pleasure of meeting several times during my stay in Monterey. As military commandant during the governorship of Alvarado, he exercised almost supreme sway over the country. He is a man of forty-five years of age, tall and of a commanding presence; his head is large, forehead high and ample, and eyes dark, with a grave, dignified expression. He is better acquainted with our institutions and laws than any other native Californian."" Thomes says: (1843) The next morning, when all hands were called I was again dispatched to Seora Abaronos (Briones) rancho for milk, as General M. G. Vallejo was on board and it was necessary to give him a feast, he owning half a million acres of land, and fifty thousand head of cattle, so it was reported. He was a very gentlemanly Mexican, and quite affable to us boys, often giving us a silver dollar for pulling him on board the ship and on shore. William Kelly says: I waited on the general, (at his Sonoma house in 1850) who is an enormously rich man, and was received with the greatest courtesy and hospitality. He is a fine, handsome man, in the prime of life, of superior attainments and great natural talent: the only native Californian in the senate. His lady is also possessed of unusual personal attractions and of that easy dignity and cordiality of manner so peculiarly characteristic of Spanish ladies. His house is a fine one superbly furnished and wanting in nothing that comfort or luxury requires.In common with most Californians General Vallejo was most careless and improvident when money was plenty, and while he realized large sums from the sale of lands and cattle, his later years were passed in comparative poverty. The town of Vallejo was named for him and a street in San Francisco bears his name. He, had sixteen children, of whom ten lived to maturity. One daughter married John B. Frisbie, captain of company H, Stevensons regiment, and another married his brother Levi. One married Arpad Harasthy and the two younger daughters married Don Ricardo de Empron and James H. Cutter.

Actually, you should never lay toilet paper down on the seat because toilet seats are really cleverly designed.

As a result, all those germs spread around the room and also on the toilet paper. And contrary to the toilet seat, toilet paper is an ideal place for germs to gather. Its surface makes it easy for bacteria to settle on. It is precisely this germ-infested toilet paper that you would reach out to grab with your hands and then, unconsciously, you would touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body.You might be covering yourself in germs every time you flush the toilet: pic.twitter.com/ouLLTftq1a You might be covering yourself in germs every time you flush the toilet: _LINKS_  Women's Health (@WomensHealthMag)  Women's Health (@WomensHealthMag) June 9, 2016The same thing applies to the taps and hand dryers.

People use the taps straight after doing their business, making the tap a real germ magnet. And the tap gets touched again after people are finished washing their hands. The same goes for electric hand dryers. In fact, a recent study showed that electric hand dryers spread bacteria to a large extent.As a first point, the electric hand dryers stir up the air in the room and thereby launch the microbes and viral particles into the air and all over the room. Secondly, after washing hands, there are often residual germs, which instead of being removed by the hand driers, actually get spread all the more. In general, the greater the airflow, the greater the germ problem. The best alternative is paper towels. They get rid of significantly more germs.So there you go, from now on you might look upon toilet paper more critically than the toilet seat itself.

This is one of the most effective ways to reduce discrimination in law enforcement and it needs to be beefed up and increased to cover as many of the 18,000-plus local law enforcement jurisdictions.[lz_jwplayer video= iPQ16HTo ads=true]AdvertisementThat was United Nations Rapporteur Maina Kai on July 27, a representative of the U.N. Human Rights Council, who on the tail-end of touring the U.S., endorsed a little-known and yet highly controversial practice by the Justice Department to effect a federal takeover of local police and corrections departments.The Obama administration has been pursuing the federal takeover of local police right under Congress nose  and Republicans in Congress were apparently unaware it was happening.The consent decrees are already being implemented in Newark, New Jersey; Miami, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Ferguson, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; and other municipalities.AdvertisementHeres how it works: the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice files a lawsuit in federal court against a city, county, or state, alleging constitutional and civil rights violations by the police or at a corrections facility. It is done under 42 U.S.C.  14141, a section of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, granting the attorney general the power to prosecute law enforcement misconduct. The municipality then simply agrees to the judicial finding  without contest  and the result is a wide-reaching federal court order that imposes onerous regulations on local police.The federal court orders are designed to undo Rudy Giuliani-style policing tactics that were effective at reducing crime in big cities in the 1990s and 2000s.In short, the much-feared nationalization of local police departments is already being initiated by the Obama administrations Justice Department. And somehow nobody noticed.Close More from LifeZetteFederal requirements include how searches are conducted, what constitutes legitimate use of force, the mandatory use of on-body cameras by the police, and so forth. The agreements impose years-long compliance review regimes, implementation deadlines, and regular reviews by federal bureaucrats. This makes local police directly answerable to the Civil Rights Division at the DOJ.One example includes a 77-page March 30 consent decree between the department and the City of Newark, New Jersey, that resulted from a 2011 investigation, a 2014 series of findings by the Civil Rights Division, and then finally a federal lawsuit alleging police misconduct in the U.S. District Court in the District of New Jersey.The original complaint alleged that the Newark Police Department (NPD) has engaged in a pattern or practice of constitutional violations in its stop and arrest practices, responses to individuals exercise of their rights under the First Amendment, uses of force, and theft by officers. The investigation also revealed that the pattern or practice of constitutional violations stems in part from deficiencies in NPDs systems that are designed to prevent and detect misconduct, including its systems for reviewing force and investigating complaints regarding officer conduct.AdvertisementThe city of Newark, via the consent decree, agreed to the allegations and to implement a comprehensive and agency-wide policies and procedures that are consistent with and incorporate all substantive requirements of this agreement, including rules on stops, searches, use of force, etc. The city has two years to implement, with the full agreement lasting five years. Meaning  even if the political parties change power in the city of Newark, the new mayor and city council would still be required to implement the court order.[lz_table title=U.S. Cities with Active DOJ Consent Decrees source=Americans for Limited Government]City,State,Police ForceChicago,IL,11944Los Angeles,CA,10000Miami,FL,1259Ferguson,MO,54[/lz_table]These consent decrees are in essence regulations. That, is, without the niceties of administrative procedures requirements, public comments, or even any congressional oversight.AdvertisementRemarkably, congressional offices contacted by this author were generally unaware of the regulation of local policing via DOJ consent decrees with cities  even though the agreements have been implemented for years. Not a single hearing or word of protest has occurred on this topic.The lack of oversight is pathetic enough  but to make matters even worse, this could actually be the first step in a new wide-ranging body of federal rules on local police.The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulation Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) actually originated as a consent decree in 2009 against Westchester County, New York, requiring affordable housing units to be built in the county. Afterward, Republican Robert Astorino was elected county executive and yet was still required to implement the court order.AdvertisementWestchester became the basis for AFFH, where every city and county in the country that accepts any part of $3 billion of annual community development block grants to 1,200 recipient cities and counties now has to comply with HUDs dictates on zoning along racial and income guidelines.[lz_ndn video=31158785]DOJ may very well end up doing the same thing with the local police  that is, if Congress does not wise up to whats really happening and defund implementation of 42 U.S.C.  14141. This is dangerous. What is most chilling is how far along the Obama Justice Department is in this process. The breadth of regulation here shatters any notion of local governance or federalism. The Obama administration has been pursuing the federal takeover of local police right under Congress nose  and Republicans in Congress were apparently unaware it was happening.AdvertisementNo doubt the practice would continue under a Hillary Clinton administration too. Do you want a Clinton Justice Department running your local police force? That is how important the election in November suddenly becomes  with law and order already hanging in the balance and police being targeted by domestic terrorists in the slayings in Dallas and Baton Rouge.As Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning noted in a statement calling attention to the U.N.s interest in the DOJ program and urging Congress to act, The fact that the U.N. Human Rights Council  which includes some of the worst abusers of human rights in the world that hate the U.S.  is cheering for this DOJ national takeover of the police should tell members everything they need to know. Its time to support local police, not render them impotent via federal restrictions against maintaining law and order. No less than the very existence of local government is at stake.AdvertisementRobert Romano is the senior editor of Americans for Limited Government.",UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police | LifeZette,2008-04-16,Robert Romano,right,right,n,,107,
FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jeff-rothschild-third-world-war/,Did Facebook Executive Jeff Rothschild Say We Need a Third World War?,Questionable Quotes,18-May-18,"Facebook vice president Jeff Rothschild said ""In order to finalize the New World Order process we need a 3rd world war to exterminate 90% of the world's population.""",http://www.threeworldwars.com/new-world-order.htm,3,FALSE,No Error,"New World Order DefinitionIntroductionThe following article is extracted from an excellent analysis of the New World Order by author Ken Adachi which can be found at educate-yourself.org.The term New World Order (NWO) has been used by numerous politicians through the ages, and is a generic term used to refer to a worldwide conspiracy being orchestrated by an extremely powerful and influential group of genetically-related individuals (at least at the highest echelons) which include many of the world's wealthiest people, top political leaders, and corporate elite, as well as members of the so-called Black Nobility of Europe (dominated by the British Crown) whose goal is to create a One World (fascist) Government, stripped of nationalistic and regional boundaries, that is obedient to their agenda.Listen to globalist banker, Paul Warburg:We will have a world government whether you like it or not. The only question is whether that government will be achieved by conquest or consent. (February 17, 1950, as he testified before the US Senate).Their intention is to effect complete and total control over every human being on the planet and to dramatically reduce the world's population by two thirds. While the name New World Order is the term most frequently used today to loosely refer to anyone involved in this conspiracy, the study of exactly who makes up this group is a complex and intricate one. For further research sources, please see the side bar on the left.In 1992, Dr John Coleman published Conspirators Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300. With laudable scholarship and meticulous research, Dr Coleman identifies the players and carefully details the New World Order agenda of worldwide domination and control. On page 161 of the Conspirators Hierarchy, Dr Coleman accurately summarizes the intent and purpose of the Committee of 300 as follows:A One World Government and one-unit monetary system, under permanent non-elected hereditary oligarchists who self-select from among their numbers in the form of a feudal system as it was in the Middle Ages. In this One World entity, population will be limited by restrictions on the number of children per family, diseases, wars, famines, until 1 billion people who are useful to the ruling class, in areas which will be strictly and clearly defined, remain as the total world population. There will be no middle class, only rulers and the servants. All laws will be uniform under a legal system of world courts practicing the same unified code of laws, backed up by a One World Government police force and a One World unified military to enforce laws in all former countries where no national boundaries shall exist. The system will be on the basis of a welfare state; those who are obedient and subservient to the One World Government will be rewarded with the means to live; those who are rebellious will simply be starved to death or be declared outlaws, thus a target for anyone who wishes to kill them. Privately owned firearms or weapons of any kind will be prohibited.""Why the Conspiracy is UnknownThe sheer magnitude and complex web of deceit surrounding the individuals and organizations involved in this conspiracy is mind boggling, even for the most astute among us. Most people react with disbelief and skepticism towards the topic, unaware that they have been conditioned (brainwashed) to react with skepticism by institutional and media influences. Author and de-programmer Fritz Springmeier (The Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines) says that most people have built in ""slides"" that short circuit the mind's critical examination process when it comes to certain sensitive topics. ""Slides"", Springmeier reports, is a CIA term for a conditioned type of response which dead ends a person's thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic at hand. For example, the mention of the word ""conspiracy"" often solicits a slide response with many people.What most people believe to be ""Public Opinion"" is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. Public opinion polls are really taken with the intent of gauging the public's acceptance of the New World Order's planned programs. A strong showing in the polls tells them that the programming is ""taking"", while a poor showing tells the NWO manipulators that they have to recast or ""tweak"" the programming until the desired response is achieved.The NWO Modus OperandiThe NWO global conspirators manifest their agenda through the skilful manipulation of human emotions, especially fear. In the past centuries, they have repeatedly utilized a contrivance that NWO researcher and author David Icke has characterized in his latest book, The Biggest Secret, as Problem, Reaction, and Solution.The technique is as follows: NWO strategists create the Problem - by funding, assembling, and training an ""opposition"" group to stimulate turmoil in an established political power (sovereign country, region, continent, etc.) that they wish to impinge upon and thus create opposing factions in a conflict that the NWO themselves maneuvered into existence. In recent decades, so called opposition groups are usually identified in the media as 'freedom fighters' or 'liberators'.At the same time, the leader of the established political power where the conflict is being orchestrated is demonized and, on cue, referred to as 'another Hitler' (take your pick: Saddam Hussein, Milosevic, Kadaffi, etc.). The 'freedom fighters' are not infrequently assembled from a local criminal element (i.e. KLA, drug traffickers). In the spirit of true Machiavellian deceit, the same NWO strategists are equally involved in covertly arming and advising the leader of the established power as well (the NWO always profits from any armed conflict by loaning money, arming, and supplying all parties involved in a war).The conflict is drawn to the world stage by the controlled media outlets with a barrage of photos and video tape reports of horrific and bloody atrocities suffered by innocent civilians. The cry goes up ""Something has to be done!"" And that is the desired Reaction.The NWO puppeteers then provide the Solution by sending in UN 'Peace Keepers' (Bosnia) or a UN 'Coalition Force' (Gulf War) or NATO Bombers and then ground troops (Kosovo), or the military to 'search for Weapons of Mass Destruction', which of course are never found. Once installed, the 'peace keepers' never leave. The idea is to have NWO controlled ground troops in all major countries or strategic areas where significant resistance to the New World Order takeover is likely to be encountered.Who is the NWO?The corporate portion of the NWO is dominated by international bankers, oil barons and pharmaceutical cartels, as well as other major multinational corporations. The Royal Family of England, namely Queen Elizabeth II and the House of Windsor, (who are, in fact, descendants of the German arm of European Royalty - the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family - changed the name to Windsor in 1914), are high level players in the oligarchy which controls the upper strata of the NWO. The decision making nerve centers of this effort are in London (especially the City of London), Basel Switzerland, and Brussels (NATO headquarters).The United Nations, along with all the agencies working under the UN umbrella, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), are full time players in this scheme. Similarly, NATO is a military tool of the NWO.The leaders of all major industrial countries like the United States, England, Germany, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, etc. (members of the ""G7/G8"" ) are active and fully cooperative participants in this conspiracy. In this century, the degree of control exerted by the NWO has advanced to the point that only certain hand-picked individuals, who are groomed and selected are even eligible to become the prime minister or president of countries like England, Germany, or The United States. It didn't matter whether Bill Clinton or Bob Dole won the Presidency in 1996, the results would have been the same. Both men are playing on the same team for the same ball club. Anyone who isn't a team player is taken out: i.e. President Kennedy, Ali Bhutto (Pakistan) and Aldo Moro (Italy). More recently, Admiral Borda and William Colby were also killed because they were either unwilling to go along with the conspiracy to destroy America, weren't cooperating in some capacity, or were attempting to expose/ thwart the takeover agenda.The NWO's Role in Shaping HistoryMost of the major wars, political upheavals, and economic depression/recessions of the past 100 years (and earlier) were carefully planned and instigated by the machinations of these elites. They include The Spanish-American War (1898), World War I and World War II; The Great Depression; the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917; the Rise of Nazi Germany; the Korean War; the Vietnam War; the 1989-91 ""fall"" of Soviet Communism; the 1991 Gulf War; the War in Kosovo; and the two Iraq wars. Even the French Revolution was orchestrated into existence by elements of the NWO.The instigation of a trumped-up war as a cover for amassing fortunes which can be dated back to at least the 12th Century when only a core group of nine members of the Knights Templar, kicked off the The Crusades that lasted for over a century and a half.The core group mentioned above have been reported as being the military arm of a secret society known as the Priory of Sion, but this has been proven to be a hoax,In 1307, the king of France, Philippe the Fair, coveted the wealth and was jealous of the Templars' power. The French king set out to arrest all the Templars in France on October 13. While many Templars were seized and tortured, including their Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, many other Templars (who had been tipped off) escaped. They eventually resurfaced in Portugal, in Malta (as the Knights of Malta) and later in Scotland as The Scottish Rites of Freemasonry, with Albert Pike playing a key role in defining a plan for establishing a world government.The acquisition and consolidation of ever greater wealth, natural resources, total political power, and control over others are the motivating forces which drive the decisions of the NWO leaders. The toll in human suffering and the loss of innocent lives are non issues for these individuals.",What is the New World Order ?,,,context,context,n,,108,

The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when theyre calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. Its not their fault, and we shouldnt hold them responsible.Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood.Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.Despite the organizations efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white sharks image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white sharks image as a peaceful marine creature..",Greenpeace activist gets arm bitten off after hugging a white shark,2002-02-18,,right,right,n,,109,

It has hunted in the Southeastern wetlands as an apex predator, unaffected by sea levels or fluctuating temperatures. Nearly hunted to extinction by 1950, alligators were one of thespecies in 1962. They helped usher in the creation of theand by 1987, the alligator had become a rousing success story, pronounced fully recovered.With healthy levels returned, they demonstrated the programs effectiveness and future promise.Today, the American alligators story is experiencing another plot twist.Cavan The American alligator has been so protected, its now over-populated, said Nathan Richard, the executive chef ofin New Orleans. Hes both passionate and creative when it comes to cooking alligator  hes done nose-to-tail preparations and hosted a vanishing wetlands supper series. For Richard, normalizing this protein on menus again is essential to protecting the Louisiana wetlands.Too many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed, he said, as we tucked into a bowl of his incredible curry piquant. Fried alligator tenderloin was slathered in a coconut sauce, made from hot red curry, fish sauce, soy, sliced ginger and gochujang paste. It was fragrant and spicy, bringing both moments of classic Louisiana flavor with intense notes of Southeast Asian cuisine. A perfectly crackled exterior resembled fried chicken, but the meat within was more akin in consistency to a super-tender octopus.The interior at Cavan Sara Essex BradleyThis overpopulation also means a physical destruction of the marshes and the destruction of fishing traps and bait, said Richard. Thats a problem for the commercial fishermen. Our wetlands and marshes are our first line of defense against hurricanes, and without them, the flooding will become even more extreme.While Richard is not the only man cooking gator in New Orleans, hes likely one of the few chefs of his caliber with such a hands-on approach to the animal in the wild.Boating through the bayou in Louisiana Jenny Adams/MicIve been hunting alligator since I was a kid growing up in Thibodaux, Louisiana, he said. Alligator is not only high-protein and low-fat, its also able to be sustainably sourced. The way we trap them, theres no pain or stress until the moment its killed. If you do it right, its very, very fast.And if you do it wrong? I asked.If you hunt alligator wrong, youre in big trouble, he said with a laugh. The sound fits his massive frame  when hes not hunting gator, Richards is a volunteer fireman.His exploration of new ways to cook alligator continues to excite guests whove come to love the meat. Its far beyond fried alligator bites in a basket  a common sight in the city.I learned from Australian crocodile recipes that you can do a baby-back ribs, he said. When I worked at Kingfish, I hosted nose-to-tail dinners. For those, I broke down an entire alligator and prepared each part differently. The cheek is delicious, but the liver is totally inedible. His grits and alligator grillades arrived on the Cavan menu this winter, with pan-fried cutlets cooked in bacon fat and braised in a reduction of celery, onions, bell pepper and garlic  served over stone-ground, mascarpone and edam cheese grits.Chef Nathan Richard at Cavan CavanI was eager to get a more up-close-and-personal look at the wetlands, and, admittedly, at the alligators. It turns out, a lot of people are similarly inclined and hunting (with professionals) is now a tourism activity.Cypress Point Richard has become friends with a biologist and conservationist, Dr. Ray J. Matherne, the owner of a 1,700-acre wetland preserve about 30 minutes from New Orleans in Bayou Des Allemands. Matherne has spent a lifetime studying this ecosystem and today takes guests on tours, crawfish harvests. In September  the only month alligator hunting is legal  hell even take guests on two-day alligator hunts. Theres no place to stay directly on his property, but the drive isnt too long from New Orleans.40% of all the wetlands in the U.S United States Geological Survey Louisianas 3 million acres of wetlands represent. According to the, they are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually. In Des Allemands and other bayous like it, you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt.The wetlands at Cypress Point Jenny Adams/MicThirty years ago, the demand for hides was tremendous, Matherne said, as we set out in a duo of small, battered outboards, not quite as long as a fully grown gator. But with the anti-fur movement, it has dropped considerably. Now, we hunt for population control and we hunt to save the wetlands. Theres no doubt hunting also benefits these bayou communities in other ways  from the processors to locals who have their own, day-to-day issues with this overpopulation. Hes an expert on the area. You can see egrets, heron, ibis and even bald eagles nesting, he said. And we do a private alligator harvest, a crawfish harvest, fishing, duck hunting and bass fishing.Mathernes preserve has Spanish moss dripping dreamily off cypress, gum, and oak trees. Its easy to forget we are here for a hunt  the first of a two-day hunt is rather relaxing. We set traps using 12-foot long willow poles with a long, nylon rope tied to both ends. The poles are planted at a 45-degree angle deep into the mud. On the top of each pole, a piece of raw chicken hangs from a massive, metal hook dangling about a foot off the water.The alligators begin their own hunt at dusk. Sniffing the rotten meat, they burst from the water to swallow the it whole, settling on the mud below to digest  without noticing that theyve swallowed a hook and line, too.The alligators from the hunt before they are processed Jenny Adams/MicLets say we never came back, said Matherne on the second day of our hunt. It would do them no harm. An alligators digestive system is so acidic, its strong enough to dissolve a hubcap. In a matter of days, it would all dissolve, and the alligator would swim away.A missing chicken alerts us we might have a gator. Richard stands in the boat, hauling the pole and line upwards. Another hunter stands alongside him with a rifle pointed at the water. Its mere seconds before an 11-foot alligator rises to the surface, suddenly furious and thrashing. The water is boiling and the boats are rocking with considerable force. Birds go screaming from the tree canopy. If you need anything to hunt an alligator, I realize, its an incredible trifecta of balance, bravery and marksmanship  falling in would likely mean death. A quick bullet is fired into the center of alligators the head, and just like that, the swamp goes quiet again.",Eating alligator in New Orleans could help save the wetlands of Louisiana,1/19/18,,right,right,n,,114,

The only way to stop the craziness is to press charges.The Chicago Police Department said in a news release sent Saturday night that three men from Chicago and a 45-year-old woman from Michigan were arrested and charged for participating in a disturbance at the protest Friday night.At a rally in Dayton, Ohio, Saturday, a man tried to breach the security buffer at the event and he was removed rapidly and professionally, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. Secret Service agents rushed the stage to protect the billionaire business mogul.Thomas Dimassimo was identified as the barrier jumper. He was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct, Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer said.Trumps path continued onto Kansas City, Mo. where he was interrupted numerous times. At least seven individuals stalled the rally in the first few minutes.""I think they're Bernie [Sanders] supporters,"" Trump said of the protesters, pointing to at least one protester the Republican frontrunner said was holding a sign in support of the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump canceled his rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago on Friday after violence broke out in the arena where he was scheduled to speak. He spoke later to Fox News, saying he canceled the event because he didnt want to see people get hurt.He said he made the decision to cancel after meeting with law enforcement authorities. Trump also said his First Amendment rights had been violated.Hours earlier, Trump supporters and opponents stood calmly in a line together waiting to get inside. Police horses and barricades kept the bulk of the demonstrators across the street.Trump opponents were protesting what they called his divisive comments, particularly about Muslims and Mexicans. Dozens of UIC faculty and staff had petitioned university administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns it would create a ""hostile and physically dangerous environment.""At one point, nearly 20 officers who had been manning barricades suddenly bolted for an intersection across a street bridge over a freeway -- where protesters shouted at and jostled with police already there. An officer was seen walking from that intersection with blood on his head.For Sunday, Trump is expected to make a stop in Bloomington, Illinois. He is expected to be met with more protests and local officials said they would be deploying extra police.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Trump threatens to 'press charges' against protesters after latest chaos,3/13/16,,context,context,n,,117,

He was part of a tourist group visiting Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station through luxury tourism company White Desert. The trip was expected to last through December 12.He had congestion in his lungs and was told not to take the long flight home until it had cleared, Korp posted on Aldrin's website.""I started to feel a bit short of breath so the staff decided to check my vitals,"" Aldrin said on the website. ""After some examination they noticed congestion in my lungs and that my oxygen levels were low which indicated symptoms of altitude sickness. This prompted them to get me out on the next flight to McMurdo and once I was at sea level I began to feel much better.""'I'm extremely grateful'A White Desert doctor and the US Antarctic Program doctor decided an evacuation would the best precautionary measure, according to a release from the company. The tourism operator made a request for a medical evacuation to the National Science Foundation, and it agreed.Aldrin was placed on the first available flight to McMurdo Station, on the Antarctic coast. A US Antarctic Program doctor traveled with him. From McMurdo, another flight took Aldrin to New Zealand.""I'm extremely grateful to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for their swift response and help in evacuating me from the Admunsen-Scott Science Station to McMurdo Station and on to New Zealand. I had been having a great time with the group at White Desert's camp before we ventured further south,"" Aldrin said. ""I really enjoyed the time I spent talking with the Science Station's staff too.""Seven Corners, the travel insurance company responsible for Aldrin's care, worked directly with Aldrin to monitor on-site medical care and arrange travel for his family, according to a statement from the company. They also helped coordinate his transportation with a medical escort back to the US.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Aldrin was eager to visit the South Pole to cap his personal exploration achievements, according to Korp. After all, he had spacewalked and was the second man to walk on the moon in the 1960s, traveled underwater to see the Titanic in 1996 and visited the North Pole in 1998. And to scientists, Antarctica's conditions are similar to what they expect on the surface of Mars.""I didn't get as much time to spend with the scientists as I would have liked to discuss the research they're doing in relation to Mars,"" Aldrin said. ""My visit was cut short and I had to leave after a couple of hours. I really enjoyed my short time in Antarctica and seeing what life could be like on Mars.""Remembering John GlennAldrin also honored his friend, former astronaut and US senator John Glenn, who died Thursday.""As I sit in hospital and just heard that my friend John Glenn has passed away, I feel fortunate to be recovering from my own illness, but saddened that we lost another space pioneer and world icon,"" Aldrin said on his website.Aldrin met Glenn in 1953, when Aldrin was a fighter pilot in South Korea and Glenn was the Ops officer. They would meet again as astronauts. He said the last time they saw each other was at former astronaut Neil Armstrong's memorial in 2012, but they had kept in touch by phone and email.""I was very saddened to hear that John was ill over the past year,"" Aldrin said. ""Since he was the last remaining Mercury astronaut, I was always lobbying him to encourage the Apollo guys to do regular reunions annually since we're not getting any younger. I am very sorry that he has departed us with his wisdom. I join that crowd of people and the entire nation and the world in paying homage to his service.""",Buzz Aldrin out of hospital after Antarctica evacuation,2012-09-16,Ashley Strickland,context,context,n,,118,

General Assembly approved a compromise bill that repealed House Bill 2 but restricts anti-discrimination ordinances in cities and counties. Gov. Roy Cooper signed the measure into law. The story below follows HB2 from its passage.In a one-day specially convened session on March 23, 2016 North Carolinas legislature passed a sweeping law that reverses a Charlotte ordinance that had extended some rights to people who are gay or transgender.The law passed by the General Assembly and signed that same night by Gov. Pat McCrory goes further than a narrow elimination of Charlottes ordinance, which had generated the most controversy by a change that protected transgender people who use public restrooms based on their gender identity. The new law also nullified local ordinances around the state that would have expanded protections for the LGBT community.SIGN UPBe the first to know.

SIGN ME UP!The state has long had laws regulating workplace discrimination, use of public accommodations, minimum wage standards and other business issues. The new law  known as HB2, the Charlotte bathroom bill or, more officially, as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act  makes it illegal for cities to expand upon those state laws, as more than a dozen cities had done, including Charlotte, Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Durham.North Carolinas new law sets a statewide definition of classes of people who are protected against discrimination: race, religion, color, national origin, age, handicap or biological sex as designated on a persons birth certificate. Sexual orientation  people who are gay  was never explicitly protected under state law and is not now, despite recent court decisions that legalized same-sex marriage.Transgender people who have not taken surgical and legal steps to change the gender noted on their birth certificates have no legal right under state law to use public restrooms of the gender with which they identify. Cities and counties no longer can establish a different standard. Critics of the Charlotte ordinance cite privacy concerns and say it was social engineering to allow people born as biological males to enter womens restrooms.McCrorys office says businesses arent limited by the bill, and that private companies and private universities can adopt new or keep existing nondiscrimination policies. Private businesses can establish their own practices concerning LGBT employees and customers.The pushback has been intense. On July 21, the National Basketball Association announced it will move its All-Star Game from Charlotte in 2017, which will cost the city an estimated $100 million. That decision follows cancellations of business expansions and entertainment events by companies and performers protesting HB2.In September, the reprisals against the state have intensified. On Sept. 12, the NCAA removed seven championships scheduled to be held in North Carolina during the 2016-17 academic year, including two rounds on the wildly popular mens basketball tournament -- all because of HB2.Forty-eight hours later the Atlantic Coast Conference followed suit. It announced it was moving the conferences football championship game in December from Charlotte, again in protest to the law.HB2 supporters from McCrory on down dug in, setting the stage for November elections in which the law was expected to play a potentially decisive role, even as the courts continue the process of deciding whether HB2 discriminates. McCrory lost his bid for reelection to Attorney General Roy Cooper. Observers of all political stripes agreed that the governor's support of HB2 probably cost him the election.On Dec. 19, 2016, following a surprise move by the Charlotte City Council, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory Monday called for a special session Wednesday, Dec. 21 to consider repeal of House Bill 2.McCrorys call came hours after the Charlotte City Council voted 10-0 with Mayor Jennifer Roberts support to rescind the LGBT ordinance that prompted HB 2.On Dec. 21, the N.C. Senate voted down a repeal of HB2 after a day of increasingly partisan rancor that pitted conservative Republicans against the Charlotte they so distrust. The state House adjourned without voting on repeal of the bill that has cost North Carolina millions of dollars in lost jobs, sports events and boycotts. With that, the hope of compromise between legislators and Charlotte, which enacted the ordinance that gave rise to HB2, dissolved.Here are additional questions and answers about the new law:Does HB2 affect rights of people who arent gay or transgender?Yes. The law changes the way people pursue claims of discrimination because of race, religion, color, national origin, biological sex or handicap in state courts. While the legislature amended HB2 to restore the rights of residents to sue on these grounds in state courts, it shortened the window for filing complaints from three years to one.The law also means a city or county cannot set a minimum wage standard for private employers.Are other states taking the same approach?Yes. Some states and local governments are considering or even passed new laws aimed at blocking specific LGBT rights. The national headquarters of the ACLU describes North Carolinas HB2 as the most extreme anti-LGBT measure in the country. Some legal experts say the N.C. bill combines elements of laws in other states that make it more comprehensive. South Dakotas legislature passed a bill focused specifically on public schools; that bill was vetoed by the governor, the ACLU said. States that recently have proposed similar measures include Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, experts say.None has the sweep of HB2, UNC Chapel Hill law professor Maxine Eichner said in May. ""Nobody has passed a law like this.""How big a court fight will this be?At least five lawsuits have been filed against or in support of the law. On one side: The ACLU, Equality North Carolina and other groups sued within days of HB2 becoming law. The U.S. Justice Department followed on May 9 after first warning the state that the law jeopardizes billions of federal dollars the state receives each year in money for schools, colleges and other issues.Also in early May, McCrory and Republican legislative leaders Phil Berger and Tim Moore filed their own complaints, accusing the federal government of distorting discrimination law to include LGBT protections and asking the federal courts to deem HB2 nondiscriminatory.The cases have been filed in two separate federal courts and have been assigned to three different judges.The ACLU and the U.S. Justice Department has asked a judge to suspend HB2 while its lawsuit is being decided, arguing that damage is done to the LGBT community every day the law is in place.On Aug. 26, 2016, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder gave the HB2 critics a partial victory when he banned the University of North Carolina from enforcing HB2 against the transgender plaintiffs in the lawsuit pending his ruling in the trial.Federal documents indicate the trial on the ACLU's lawsuit could take place as early as October or November. It would not be unreasonable to expect Schroeder's ruling by the summer of 2017, perhaps before. The losing side would almost certainly appeal to a higher court.Meanwhile, 21 states have joined North Carolina in opposing the federal mandate that transgender individuals be allowed to use the public bathrooms that matches their sexual identity or lose federal money.On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide order blocking the Obama administration order that would give transgender students in public schools access to bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity.The ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed OConnor, who is hearing the lawsuit by the 21 states, dealt a setback to the governments argument that Title IX anti-discrimination protections apply to transgender students. It also moves the battle over transgender rights one procedural step closer to a showdown in the Supreme Court.What federal protections exist for workplace discrimination for LGBT employees?There is no federal law that specifically prohibits discrimination against LGBT citizens in their jobs. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act that would do so has been proposed for many years, but has not passed.Can someone be fired in North Carolina for being gay or transgender?Yes. North Carolina is an at will employment state and offers limited protection for all workers. State law has never included protections for workers who are LGBT. The language in HB2 makes it more clear that the state does not intend to create a new class of protections based on sexual orientation or identity, and also will not allow cities and counties to create such a protected class.How does HB2 affect schools?Under HB2, North Carolina now requires students to use public school restrooms and locker rooms based on the gender on their birth certificates. The federal government says that violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in all school programs. The federal government includes sexual identity and orientation under the broader category of sex discrimination.McCrory and other HB2 supporters accuse the Justice Department, the U.S. Department of Education and other federal officials of ""radically reinterpreting"" discrimination law to include LGBT individuals. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has precedence in North Carolina, ruled in a recent Virginia transgender bathroom case that the federal agencies acted within their rights to include LGBT protections.That leaves the state's public colleges, universities and local school districts caught in the middle of a bitter court fight, with potentially billions of federal education dollars at stake.North Carolina's school superintendent said in May that school districts across the state were not complying with HB2. That appeared to be the case in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, the state's second largest district. The Rowan-Salisbury schools did say it would follow state law while respecting the privacy of all of its students.The University of North Carolina System announced in May it will not enforce HB2.Where is public opinion in North Carolina on LGBT rights?In 2012, a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage passed with more than 60 percent of the vote. A June 2015 poll from the Democrat-leading Public Policy Polling of Raleigh showed that 44 percent of state residents supported same-sex marriage, with 46 percent opposed. Last April, an Elon University poll found that 63 percent of the states registered voters disagreed with the states magistrate law. The same poll showed that 51 percent of Republicans supported a business right to deny service to customers based on religious objections.On HB2, an Elon poll in late April showed that 49 percent of state residents polled supported the bathroom provisions of the law.What are some of the political factors driving this?Conservative religious groups within North Carolina are taking some credit for getting HB2 passed into law, and pro-LGBT rights advocates note there is financial support from national groups with similar interests. Many also believe gay and transgender issues are being used by politicians to motivate voters in a presidential and gubernatorial election year. In North Carolina, both Republicans and Democrats are using HB2 as a rallying point for supporters, with each side believing that the law can win them votes.Nowhere are the battle lines more clearly drawn than in the governor's race between McCrory, an HB2 defender, and Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who believes the law should be repealed.Predictably, both came out on different sides on the NBA decision to move the All-Star game, using powerful statements to attack each other.Southern Evangelical Seminary president Richard Land says the situation may indicate a growing anger in the country on both the left and right. I dont like the form the revolution is taking, he said. Donald Trump is coarse and crude and frankly, dangerous, but I understand what is behind it. ...The establishment in Washington shows signs of existing more for its own benefit than for the people they were elected to serve.How did Democrats vote on HB2?The vote in the N.C. House was 84-25 after three hours of debate, with all Republicans voting for it and 11 Democrats breaking ranks with their party to support the bill. In the Senate, the vote was 32-0 after the Democrats walked out in protest, saying they had not been allowed to participate in the process. McCrory, a Republican, then signed it into law.Could this hurt economic development and tourism in North Carolina?It already has. The loss of the sporting events will cost the economy millions, a loss that will trickle down through the hotel and restaurant sectors.After the law passed, PayPal canceled a much-ballyhooed expansion in Charlotte that would have included 400 jobs.In the Triangle, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals said it was reconsidering a research and manufacturing facility in Durham that included 52 jobs and a $20 million investment.Now the NBA decision eliminates an estimated $100 million windfall for the Charlotte area.Major employers in North Carolina  American Airlines, Lowes, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, to name a few  all have said theyre disappointed with the measure, though they havent threatened to pull out from the state.On the entertainment front, headline acts from Bruce Springsteen to Itzhak Perlman and Pearl Jam have canceled shows in Charlotte, Greensboro and other N.C. venues. On Friday, May 20, Maroon 5 joined the list.On tourism and economic-development fronts, some business leaders say the new law is feeding a perception that North Carolina isnt inclusive.The British government went so far as to issue a travel advisory to its LGBT citizens who planned to travel to the state.The N.C. Justice Center says that if federal money for education, job training and public safety is withheld -- which most believe is unlikely -- the state could lose 53,000 jobs or $2.4 billion in wages. Conservatives say those numbers are wildly high and being used as a scare tactic.If boycotts happen, do they work?South Carolina was the subject of many boycotts for flying the Confederate flag at the state capitol. The NAACP announced a national boycott of the state in 2000. Tourism officials estimated the state lost $7 million in the first month as groups from the NCAA to the American Bar Association joined the protest. The loss of sporting events alone cost Columbia, Charleston and Greenville-Spartanburg millions of dollars every year, reports say. The flag was removed last year not because of boycotts, but after the mass killings at a Charleston church that appear to have been racially motivated.Havent cities other than Charlotte expanded nondiscrimination ordinances?Charlottes ordinance was the first of its kind in North Carolina. Three South Carolina cities have similar ordinances: Columbia, Charleston and Myrtle Beach. Theyre written differently, but conceptually are identical to what Charlotte did, city attorney Bob Hagemann has said. Those South Carolina cities and more than 200 other cities around the nation where similar ordinances exist have not reported problems with transgender bathroom use.This story was updated on Sept. 14, 2016THE RALEIGH NEWS & OBSERVER CONTRIBUTED.",Understanding HB2: North Carolinas newest law solidifies states role in defining discrimination | Charlotte Observer,,Michael Gordon,context,context,n,,122,
TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/united-states-deporting-veterans/,Does the United States Deport Military Veterans?,Politics  Immigration,08-Feb-16,The United States is deporting military veterans.,http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/nov/12/us-veterans-banished-mexico/,2,FALSE,No Error,"Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames. Content can be viewed at actual source page: _LINKS_How many U.S. veterans are deported each year? No one knows, but a group of ""banished veterans"" in Mexico are trying to help. Hector Barajas lives in a rundown apartment in Rosarito, Mexico. His small living room is cluttered with makeshift items appropriated as furniture: upended 20-gallon bucket chairs, chipped TV dinner trays trying to stand alone on teetering bent legs. There's even a door-less broken fridge that serves as a bookshelf.After growing up in Compton, California, Barajas served for seven years in the U.S Army's 82nd Airborne Division. He had a green card, and was proud to serve what he considered to be his country.Now, Barajas says, he never imagined he'd be banned for life from the United States.""I was a legal resident when I entered the military in 1995,"" he said. ""I got out in 2001 with two honorable discharges. I was under the impression that I was a U.S. citizen automatically because of the recruiters.""That wasn't the case. Though military service can speed up the process of becoming a citizen, it's not automatic. Barajas got into trouble after leaving the military, and was convicted for discharging a firearm into a vehicle. He served a 3-year prison sentence. Because he had a green card, the conviction meant that he was subject to mandatory deportation.If he had been a U.S. citizen, Barajas would have walked free after serving his time. Instead, he was taken into ICE custody, brought across the border, and dropped off in Tijuana.His family remained behind in California.For the first few months, Barajas struggled to adjust. With help from another deported veteran, he found a modest apartment in Rosarito, about 15 miles south of the border. He's been there since 2004.At first, Barajas says, he found work in a senior care facility in his neighborhood, tending to elderly American retirees. The job paid poorly, and didn't last. His hopes of eventually returning to the U.S. and a desire to help other deported vets led him to his next job: a fulltime, unpaid, effort.Barajas decided to use his cramped living quarters as a makeshift drop-in shelter, which quickly became the headquarters of the growing organization ""Banished Veterans.""""I'm doing something that somebody did for me, when I first got here,"" Barajas said. ""You're supposed to take care, you're supposed to leave no man behind. I'm a firm believer""He trailed off, looked around, and chuckled. ""I mean, to the best of your ability. This is a small apartment.""Fabian Rebolledo, 36, is a recent arrival to Mexico. He's a Kosovo combat vet and former Army paratrooper. Rebolledo arrived just four months ago, after spending twenty-four years in Los Angeles.""My deportation was due to a violation of probation,"" he said. ""It was due to a insufficient funds check. Seven hundred fifty dollars.""Like Barajas, Rebolledo thought that military service would protect him.""I was a legal resident,"" he said. ""And actually, I joined the military because I wanted to become a citizen. I was going to be the first member of my family to become a citizen""But before the bad check, Rebolledo had two DUI convictions. Although his crimes were nonviolent, they were still enough to ban him from the U.S. for the rest of his life.That's because of a 1996 immigration law that expanded the list of crimes considered to be ""aggravated felonies."" The law made some misdemeanor crimes result in permanent, mandatory deportation for non-citizens.Today, Hector and his fellow banned veterans would like to see some judicial discretion come into play in these cases, taking military service into account. Some politicians, like Bob Filner, former Chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs and newly elected Mayor of San Diego, have shown some sympathy for these efforts.Right now, not only is there no judicial review  there's also no one keeping count of how many vets are deported.""No, no,"" said Lauren Mack, spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in San Diego. ""We don't track vets.""Neither does anyone else.Immigration attorney Craig Shagin says that getting hard numbers is impossible. Even attorneys representing vets in court, ""may not even be asking their clients, 'have you ever served in the military?' Because it isn't an outcome affirmative of anything, it's not going to change anything.""From the Banned Vet headquarters in his Rosarito apartment, Barajas has been keeping a tally. ""I started making a list of for the hell of it,"" he said. ""It grew into something bigger, something people want to know about.""Today, he says, he's spoken personally to 103 U.S. military veterans who have been deported to various countries. He estimates that between 500 and 1000 deported vets live in Tijuana and Rosarito alone, with thousands more scattered around the world.Barajas is searching for other deported vets and trying to rally them and others. It's a lot like amateur detective work. He makes phones calls, follows leads, sends Facebook requests, and tracks social media.Vets who commit crimes, do time, and are then deported can still be eligible for benefits. However, it's impossible for them to collect most of those benefits.Nevertheless, there is one benefit they can collect: burial.""We had a guy who died about four months ago,"" Barajas said. ""He was deported, not allowed to go into the U.S. When (he) died, they let his body go. And then they gave him a nice certificate, thank you for serving our country. When I die, I can be buried as an American.""It's true. Unless they've been dishonorably discharged, the Office of Veteran's Affairs says that all military veterans are indeed entitled to a burial in a national cemetery.Immigration law doesn't restrict the corpses of veterans from coming ""home"" to American soil.Only then can deported vets re-enter the country legally, in order to be laid to rest as American service members: with a grave marker and a American flag.To view PDF documents, Download Acrobat Reader.",US Veterans Banished To Mexico,2011-12-12,Erin Siegal,right,context,right,,123,

I didnt intervene in the activities of the police.He dined regularly at restaurants in Port-au-Prince, Haitis capital, and attended events at the invitation of Mr. Martelly, whose administration has included relatives and allies of people associated with Mr. Duvalier.A brief statement released by Mr. Martellys office said he learned of Mr. Duvaliers death with great sadness and made no mention of the former presidents iron-fisted rule.On behalf of the entire government and people of Haiti, I take this sad occasion to extend my sincere sympathies to his family, his relatives and his supporters across the country, Mr. Martelly said.Richard Sassine, a close friend of Mr. Duvalier, told The Miami Herald that Mr. Duvalier had been writing a memoir that would correct misunderstandings about him and his tenure.He was a gentle giant, Mr. Sassine said. Not this tyrant.This year, his old political party announced that it would field candidates in elections, and opened an office, though analysts were not sure if it was a serious move or a thumb in the eye of the rival he loathed, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, another formerly exiled president who also returned and still is a political force.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, as political repression and a worsening economy set off violent unrest in the hemispheres poorest country. He asked France for asylum and the United States for the plane to take him there, an American official said at the time.His departure set the stage for democratic, though tumultuous, elections four years later that lifted Mr. Aristide, a former priest to the poor, to power. (Years later, he, too, was chased from the country by political upheaval.) Human rights groups have said that Mr. Duvalier looted Haitis treasury of millions of dollars and largely lived off ill-gotten gains.His presence in the country, and the fact that he will now escape trial, appalled victims and human rights workers who worked to bring him to justice.On Duvaliers death Im thinking of the look in my mothers eyes when she talks about her brother Joel who was disappeared by that dictator, Patrick Gaspard, a Haitian-American who is the United States ambassador to South Africa, said on Twitter. News of the passing of Duvalier makes me honor my father and generations of Haitians who resisted that vicious dictatorship.VideoStill, a majority of the population now was born after his departure, perhaps dampening passions for or against him.He managed with the complicity of foreign powers and domestic politicians to avoid facing justice both when he was in France and when he returned to Haiti in 2011, said Robert Fatton Jr., a University of Virginia professor and the author of Haiti: Trapped in the Outer Periphery. Because he escaped trial, the extent of his crimes and looting will not be fully documented.Mr. Duvalier was born July 3, 1951, in Port-au-Prince. Biographical sketches published when he became president described him as an introvert who liked fast cars and jazz, and a martial arts enthusiast. He spoke Spanish and French, and attended classes at the University of Haiti, though diplomats whispered that he was unprepared for office, and speculated that his fathers ministers would hold the real power.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He was like a young prince. His fathers people controlled him, and he never got out from under them.Mr. Duvalier rarely granted interviews and kept public appearances to a minimum, but details of lavish spending on art, clothing and a wedding believed to have cost $5 million trickled out of the presidential palace.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThat marriage was in 1980, to Michele Bennett, the daughter of a wealthy coffee baron, whose worldly ways and outspoken manner led many to believe she was actually running the country. They divorced in 1993.Whether of his own volition or at the urging of others, Mr. Duvalier took obvious cues from his father, and while occasionally releasing political prisoners or tolerating critical news coverage, he quickly quashed serious dissent.He curried favor with the United States, and exploited its Cold War aims to ensure that Haiti did not fall under Cubas sway by bargaining for aid, though his government did not receive all that it believed it needed.Still, investment increased and he pushed urbanization and public works projects, drawing poor farmers from the countryside to such an extent that some argue that agriculture fell into an irreversible decline. The large Haitian diaspora blossomed as people fled and sent money home, buttressing the weak economy.He welcomed nongovernment organizations to fill in what his government could not or would not do, leading to a heavy presence that still exists today.The years of Jean-Claude Duvalier were also the time of a ramping up of the current highly fragmented landscape of aid delivery in Haiti, said Laurent Dubois, an expert on modern Haitian history at Duke University.Jean-Claude Duvalier inherited a carefully constructed state apparatus for political repression from his father, and he largely maintained it during his regime, Mr. Dubois said.But he also cultivated new connections with the U.S., seeking new types of investment in the country, he added. The model of using small manufacturing to expand the economy  some talked of Haiti becoming the Taiwan of the Caribbean  was a key part of his economic policy, though even he later admitted that its ultimate success in alleviating poverty was quite limited.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAs political oppression mounted, so did stories of his extravagances.

President George H.W. Bush's ""read my lips, no new taxes"" pledge comes immediately to mind, as does President Bill Clinton reneging on his middle-class tax cut, and President Barack Obama never closing Guantanamo Bay. But in each of those cases, those were promises that were made in a given campaign by a given politician. The promise of Obamacare repeal is much different.Republicans ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare for seven years, over the course of four election cycles. They won the House majority in 2010 in large part because of the backlash against the passage of Obamacare  and the vow to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare was part of their ""Pledge to America"" campaign document that year. The botched rollout of Obamacare helped them win the Senate in 2014. House candidates, Senate candidates, gubernatorial candidates, and even state legislative candidates ran against Obamacare  and won.Though President Trump was always an unorthodox candidate on healthcare (vacillating between praising single-payer and touting a free market plan), he consistently campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare, and exploited news of spiking premiums in the weeks leading up to the presidential election.Republicans were always moving the goal posts on voters. That is, during campaign season, they made boasts about repeal, and then once in office, they talked about procedural complications. In 2010, they campaigned on repeal, but by 2011, they said they needed the Senate. In 2014, they won the Senate, but by 2015 they said as long as Obama was in office, nothing would become law. In 2016, they told conservative voters, even reluctant ones, that if they voted for Trump despite any reservations, they'd finally be able to repeal Obamacare. In November, voters gave them unified control of Washington. And yet after just two months on the job, they have thrown in the towel and said they're willing to abandon seven years of promises.There are a lot of people who want to conveniently lay the blame for this stunning failure on recalcitrant members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. If only these conservative hardliners were willing to give way, we'd be on the road to repeal, defenders of leadership would like to have us believe. This is convenient, both because there are always people in Washington eager to take aim at conservative purists, and also because it has the makings of a great ironic hot take for journalists: ""How conservatives saved Obamacare.""Now, let me be clear, in past fights, I've never been reluctant to criticize hardliners when I thought that they were being unreasonable or irresponsible. For instance, I disagreed with the hard-line position on the debt ceiling, didn't think forcing a government shutdown to defund Obamacare would work, and supported the deal that made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent (as opposed to letting them all expire). But I don't think it's fair to scapegoat Freedom Caucusers here. They are being blamed for making the naive mistake of assuming that Republicans wanted to do what they were promising to do for seven years.In this case, the hardliners were playing a productive role by pointing out the real policy consequences of the piecemeal approach being pursued by the House leadership. Though we'll never know for sure how the numbers might have looked if a vote had taken place, it's clear that many centrist members of the Republican caucus were also prepared to vote this bill down. House conservatives, if they could be blamed for anything, it's for having the audacity to urge leadership to actually honor seven years of pledges to voters to repeal Obamacare. If anybody was moving the goal posts, it wasn't Freedom Caucusers, it was those who were trying to sell a bill that kept much of Obamacare's regulatory architecture in place as a free market repeal and replace plan.Sure, I know, Republicans had a narrow majority, and they could only pass something through the Senate by reconciliation, which imposes limitations. But the thing is, Republicans don't hide behind the vagaries of Senate procedure during campaign season. Trump did not win the Republican nomination telling rallies of thousands of people, ""We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare  as long as it satisfies the Byrd rule in the judgment of the Senate parliamentarian!""What's so utterly disgraceful, is not just that Republicans failed so miserably, but that they barely tried, raising questions about whether they ever actually wanted to repeal Obamacare in the first place.Republicans for years have criticized the process that produced Obamacare, and things certainly got ugly. But after having just witnessed this debacle, I think Paul Ryan owes Nancy Pelosi an apology.One has to admire the commitment that Democrats and Obama had to delivering something they campaigned on and truly believed in. They spent 13 months getting the bill from an initial concept to final passage, and pressed on during many points when everybody was predicting doom. They had public hearings, multiple drafts of different bills, they kept negotiating, even worked into Christmas. They made significant changes at times, but also never lost sight of their key goals. They didn't back down in the face of angry town halls and after losing their filibuster-proof majority, and many members cast votes that they knew risked their political careers. Obama himself was a leader, who consistently made it clear that he was not going to walk away. He did countless rallies, meetings, speeches  even a ""summit"" at the Blair House  to try to sell the bill, talking about details, responding to criticisms of the bill to the point that he was mocked by conservatives for talking so much about healthcare.The contrast between Obama and Democrats on healthcare and what just happened is stunning. House Republicans slapped together a bill in a few weeks (months if we're being generous) behind closed doors with barely any debate. They moved the bill through committees at blazing speed, conducted closed-door negotiations that resulted in relatively minor tweaks to the bill, and within 17 days, Trump decided that he'd had enough, and was ready to walk away if members didn't accept the bill as is. It reminded me of the scene in ""Duck Soup,"" in which Groucho Marx portrays Rufus T. Firefly, leader of the fictional Freedonia. Firefly conducts a cabinet meeting that he starts by saying he'll take up old business. One official says, ""I wish to discuss the tariff."" Firefly responds, ""Sit down, that's new business."" When nobody has any old business to discuss he decides to turn to new business. ""About that tariff "" the same official interjects. ""Too late,"" Firefly responds, ""That's old business already.""This is not too far off from the process we just witnessed. Healthcare is incredibly complicated stuff, with each provision of legislation being interconnected with others. It can't be negotiated like a spending bill in which two people have a different spending target, and somehow you manage to split the difference. We know what the market is like under Obamacare and have a decent idea of what it would be like if it were repealed. But the random, piecemeal combination of changes being made to win over votes, presents everybody with completely new policy challenges that experts were scrambling to assess in real time, yet lawmakers were being asked to vote on them within hours of being adopted. And House Freedom Caucus members are the ones who don't understand how serious governing works? Give me a break.Here's the bottom line: Republicans didn't want to repeal Obamacare that badly. Obamacare was a useful tool for them. For years, they could use it to score short-term messaging victories. People are steamed about high premiums? We'll message on that today. People are angry about losing insurance coverage? We'll put out a devastating YouTube video about that. Seniors are angry about the Medicare cuts? Let's tweet about it. High deductibles are unpopular? We'll issue an email fact sheet. Or maybe a gif. At no point were they willing to do the hard work of hashing out their intraparty policy differences and developing a coherent health agenda or of challenging the central liberal case for universal coverage. Sure, if the U.S. Supreme Court did the job for them, they were okay with Obamacare going away. But when push came to shove, they weren't willing to put in the elbow grease.There was a big debate over the course of the election about how out of step Trump was with the Republican Party on many issues. But if anything, this episode shows that Trump and the GOP are perfect together  limited in attention span, all about big talk and identity politics, but uninterested in substance.Failing to get the votes on one particular bill is one thing. But failing and then walking away on seven years of promises is a pathetic abdication of duty.

One was the hacking and leaking of e-mails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta. The second was a campaign of misinformation and propaganda carried out largely over social media. The charges that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, issued on Friday concern solely the second prong. The indictment names thirteen Russians, twelve of whom worked for a shadowy, Kremlin-connected outfit called the Internet Research Agency. The Agency has been linked to a campaign of online disinformation that included the creation of hundreds of fake political pages on Facebook and accounts on Twitter that were presented as belonging to everyday Americans; during the election, according to the indictment, this disinformation campaign was aimed at boosting Donald Trump, undermining Hillary Clinton, and sowing general political discord in the United States by supporting radical causes on both sides. It was sort of like a cutting-edge social-media marketing operation run, as the indictment alleges, by a St. Petersburg-based oligarch named Yevgeny Prigozhin.Much of the information in the indictment isnt new. The Agency was first noticed by Russian media outlets in 2014, when it was dedicated mainly to spreading online propaganda in support of pro-Russian separatists in the Ukraine conflict. In the spring of 2015, when the idea of a President Donald Trump was still a laughable fantasy, I travelled to St. Petersburg to investigate the Agency, which had recently started experimenting with targeting audiences outside Russia. As I conducted my reporting, I was myself the target of an elaborate smear campaign to label me a neo-Nazi sympathizer and U.S. intelligence agentan early use of the kind of bizarre tactics that have been documented by numerous investigations in both the Russian and Western media, and by the internal investigations of social-media companies.Yet the new indictment offers the most complete look yet at the Agencys internal workings. Muellers investigators discovered that the Agency used a network of shell companiesentities with names like MediaSintez LLC, GlavSet LLC, and MixInfo LLCto hide its activities and funding. The indictment alleges that the Agency employed hundreds of workers, and that by September, 2016, it had a monthly budget of more than $1.25 million. The document details how the Agencys specialists worked in day and night shifts, and the way they were constantly trying to measure the effect of their efforts. The employees ran fake conservative Twitter and Facebook accounts, and even planned (sparsely attended) real-life rallies.The indictment also reveals previously unknown efforts that the Agency made to gather intelligence, both online and on the ground, to bolster its campaign. Agency employees assumed false identities and exchanged messages with real American political activists, who offered them tips, such as focussing on purple states like Colorado, Virginia, and Florida. At one point, two Internet Research Agency employees travelled to the U.S.passing through the states of Nevada, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, and New Yorkto gather intelligence.Back in 2016, I noticed that many of the Agency accounts I had uncovered in my investigation were tweeting pro-Trump content. According to the indictment, one memo distributed by Agency managers instructed employees to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump--we support them.) After an internal Agency review determined that a Facebook page called Secured Borders was not posting enough content critical of Clinton, an order went out saying that it is imperative to intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton in future posts.Yet the indictment does not shed light on the extent to which the Kremlin and, specifically, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, were involved in the Agencys work. Nor does the indictment move us any closer to a conclusion regarding whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian operation. The chain of command as detailed by the indictment stops at Prigozhin, who has long been identified as the chief architect of the Agency. The Times has identified Prigozhin as Putins go-to oligarch for a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria. Yet Muellers new indictment does not claim that Putin personally ordered the Agency to turn into a pro-Trump propaganda machine. When I was reporting on the Agency, some sources suggested to me that it was a project undertaken independently, in order to curry favor with Putin.None of the Russians named in the indictment face the prospect of testifying before an American jury anytime soon. And, with the 2018 midterms approaching, one question is to what extent the Internet Research Agency is still operating. Reports about the Agency, stoked by fearmongering information warfare experts, have created as much paranoia as the original disinformation campaign. The kind of clarity offered in Muellers indictment would be useful in understanding the structure and scope of Russian trolling activities today.",What Muellers Indictment Reveals About Russias Internet Research Agency,,Adrian Chen,irrelevant,irrelevant,n,,130,

It's a myth, but it's remarkable how many people believe it. Ask a few.""It's a complete urban legend,"" said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough. ""I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s, and that brought it to the mainstream.""Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole, a mouse-like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands. Three kinds are found in Alaska, including the collared lemming, the only rodent that turns white in winter.In 1958 Walt Disney produced ""White Wilderness,"" part of the studio's ""True Life Adventure"" series. ""White Wilderness"" featured a segment on lemmings, detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide.According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee, the lemming scenes were faked. The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers. The epic ""lemming migration"" was staged using careful editing, tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy-Susan style turntable.""White Wilderness"" was filmed in Alberta, Canada, a landlocked province, and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat. There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north - but evidently not in that area of Alberta. So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence.In the lemming segment, the little rodents assemble for a mass migration, scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that, ""A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny.""That destiny is to jump into the ocean. As they approach the ""sea,"" (actually a river -more tight cropping) Hibbler continues, ""They've become victims of an obsession -- a one-track thought: Move on! Move on!""The ""pack of lemmings"" reaches the final precipice. ""This is the last chance to turn back,"" Hibbler states. ""Yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space.""Life-loving lemming: lemmings do not commit mass suicide, although in lean times they may become cannibalistic. These mouse-like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world, mostly favoring tundra and open grassland.Lemmings are seen flying into the water. The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings.Certainly, some scenes in nature documentaries are staged. In Sir David Attenborough's recent documentary, ""The Life of Birds,"" the close-up footage of a flying duck, filmed razor-sharp from the bird's wingtip, was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car. But faking an entirely mythical event is something else.""Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,"" said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth.Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they've exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals.Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in ""White Wilderness,"" but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' ""weird world of frozen chaos."" The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation.""What people see is essentially mass dispersal,"" said zoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""Sometimes it's pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they 're essentially dead.""""There's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers,"" Jarrell added. ""One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore.""Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up.""It's a frequent question,"" he said ""'Do they really kill themselves?' No. The answer is unequivocal, no they don't.""Receive a monthly notice about new issues and articles.","Lemming Suicide Myth, Alaska Department of Fish and Game",,Dfg.Webmaster Alaska.Gov,right,context,right,,132,

His massive body of work, which includes nearly 100 books, has for decades deflated and exposed the lies of the power elite and the myths they perpetrate. Chomsky has done this despite being blacklisted by the commercial media, turned into a pariah by the academy and, by his own admission, being a pedantic and at times slightly boring speaker. He combines moral autonomy with rigorous scholarship, a remarkable grasp of detail and a searing intellect. He curtly dismisses our two-party system as a mirage orchestrated by the corporate state, excoriates the liberal intelligentsia for being fops and courtiers and describes the drivel of the commercial media as a form of brainwashing. And as our nations most prescient critic of unregulated capitalism, globalization and the poison of empire, he enters his 81st year warning us that we have little time left to save our anemic democracy.It is very similar to late Weimar Germany, Chomsky told me when I called him at his office in Cambridge, Mass. The parallels are striking. There was also tremendous disillusionment with the parliamentary system. The most striking fact about Weimar was not that the Nazis managed to destroy the Social Democrats and the Communists but that the traditional parties, the Conservative and Liberal parties, were hated and disappeared. It left a vacuum which the Nazis very cleverly and intelligently managed to take over.The United States is extremely lucky that no honest, charismatic figure has arisen, Chomsky went on. Every charismatic figure is such an obvious crook that he destroys himself, like McCarthy or Nixon or the evangelist preachers. If somebody comes along who is charismatic and honest this country is in real trouble because of the frustration, disillusionment, the justified anger and the absence of any coherent response. What are people supposed to think if someone says I have got an answer, we have an enemy? There it was the Jews. Here it will be the illegal immigrants and the blacks. We will be told that white males are a persecuted minority. We will be told we have to defend ourselves and the honor of the nation. Military force will be exalted. People will be beaten up. This could become an overwhelming force. And if it happens it will be more dangerous than Germany. The United States is the world power. Germany was powerful but had more powerful antagonists. I dont think all this is very far away. If the polls are accurate it is not the Republicans but the right-wing Republicans, the crazed Republicans, who will sweep the next election.I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime, Chomsky added. I am old enough to remember the 1930s. My whole family was unemployed. There were far more desperate conditions than today. But it was hopeful. People had hope. The CIO was organizing. No one wants to say it anymore but the Communist Party was the spearhead for labor and civil rights organizing. Even things like giving my unemployed seamstress aunt a week in the country. It was a life. There is nothing like that now. The mood of the country is frightening. The level of anger, frustration and hatred of institutions is not organized in a constructive way. It is going off into self-destructive fantasies.I listen to talk radio, Chomsky said. I dont want to hear Rush Limbaugh. I want to hear the people calling in. They are like [suicide pilot] Joe Stack. What is happening to me? I have done all the right things. I am a God-fearing Christian. I work hard for my family. I have a gun. I believe in the values of the country and my life is collapsing.Chomsky has, more than any other American intellectual, charted the downward spiral of the American political and economic system, in works such as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures, Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietnam War, and US Political Culture, A New Generation Draws the Line: Kosovo, East Timor and the Standards of the West, Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent and Letters From Lexington: Reflections on Propaganda. He reminds us that genuine intellectual inquiry is always subversive. It challenges cultural and political assumptions. It critiques structures. It is relentlessly self-critical. It implodes the self-indulgent myths and stereotypes we use to elevate ourselves and ignore our complicity in acts of violence and oppression. And it makes the powerful, as well as their liberal apologists, deeply uncomfortable.Chomsky reserves his fiercest venom for the liberal elite in the press, the universities and the political system who serve as a smoke screen for the cruelty of unchecked capitalism and imperial war. He exposes their moral and intellectual posturing as a fraud. And this is why Chomsky is hated, and perhaps feared, more among liberal elites than among the right wing he also excoriates. When Christopher Hitchens decided to become a windup doll for the Bush administration after the attacks of 9/11, one of the first things he did was write a vicious article attacking Chomsky. Hitchens, unlike most of those he served, knew which intellectual in America mattered. [Editors note: To see some of the articles in the 2001 exchanges between Hitchens and Chomsky, click here, here, here and here.]I dont bother writing about Fox News, Chomsky said. It is too easy. What I talk about are the liberal intellectuals, the ones who portray themselves and perceive themselves as challenging power, as courageous, as standing up for truth and justice. They are basically the guardians of the faith. They set the limits. They tell us how far we can go. They say, Look how courageous I am. But do not go one millimeter beyond that. At least for the educated sectors, they are the most dangerous in supporting power.Chomsky, because he steps outside of every group and eschews all ideologies, has been crucial to American discourse for decades, from his work on the Vietnam War to his criticisms of the Obama administration. He stubbornly maintains his position as an iconoclast, one who distrusts power in any form.Most intellectuals have a self-understanding of themselves as the conscience of humanity, said the Middle East scholar Norman Finkelstein. They revel in and admire someone like Vaclav Havel. Chomsky is contemptuous of Havel. Chomsky embraces the Julien Benda view of the world. There are two sets of principles. They are the principles of power and privilege and the principles of truth and justice. If you pursue truth and justice it will always mean a diminution of power and privilege. If you pursue power and privilege it will always be at the expense of truth and justice. Benda says that the credo of any true intellectual has to be, as Christ said, my kingdom is not of this world. Chomsky exposes the pretenses of those who claim to be the bearers of truth and justice. He shows that in fact these intellectuals are the bearers of power and privilege and all the evil that attends it.Some of Chomskys books will consist of things like analyzing the misrepresentations of the Arias plan in Central America, and he will devote 200 pages to it, Finkelstein said. And two years later, who will have heard of Oscar Arias? It causes you to wonder would Chomsky have been wiser to write things on a grander scale, things with a more enduring quality so that you read them forty or sixty years later. This is what Russell did in books like Marriage and Morals. Can you even read any longer what Chomsky wrote on Vietnam and Central America? The answer has to often be no. This tells you something about him. He is not writing for ego. If he were writing for ego he would have written in a grand style that would have buttressed his legacy. He is writing because he wants to effect political change. He cares about the lives of people and there the details count. He is trying to refute the daily lies spewed out by the establishment media. He could have devoted his time to writing philosophical treatises that would have endured like Kant or Russell. But he invested in the tiny details which make a difference to win a political battle.I try to encourage people to think for themselves, to question standard assumptions, Chomsky said when asked about his goals. Dont take assumptions for granted. Begin by taking a skeptical attitude toward anything that is conventional wisdom. Make it justify itself. It usually cant. Be willing to ask questions about what is taken for granted. Try to think things through for yourself. There is plenty of information. You have got to learn how to judge, evaluate and compare it with other things. You have to take some things on trust or you cant survive. But if there is something significant and important dont take it on trust. As soon as you read anything that is anonymous you should immediately distrust it. If you read in the newspapers that Iran is defying the international community, ask who is the international community? India is opposed to sanctions. China is opposed to sanctions. Brazil is opposed to sanctions. The Non-Aligned Movement is vigorously opposed to sanctions and has been for years. Who is the international community? It is Washington and anyone who happens to agree with it. You can figure that out, but you have to do work. It is the same on issue after issue.Chomskys courage to speak on behalf of those, such as the Palestinians, whose suffering is often minimized or ignored in mass culture, holds up the possibility of the moral life. And, perhaps even more than his scholarship, his example of intellectual and moral independence sustains all who defy the cant of the crowd to speak the truth.I cannot tell you how many people, myself included, and this is not hyperbole, whose lives were changed by him, said Finkelstein, who has been driven out of several university posts for his intellectual courage and independence. Were it not for Chomsky I would have long ago succumbed. I was beaten and battered in my professional life. It was only the knowledge that one of the greatest minds in human history has faith in me that compensates for this constant, relentless and vicious battering. There are many people who are considered nonentities, the so-called little people of this world, who suddenly get an e-mail from Noam Chomsky. It breathes new life into you.

But the short story associated with Toy Toys comes back several years. The real Lego Group was established in Denmark in 1934 by Ole Kirk Christiansen, an experienced father, and very productive wooden toys. Over a decade, the corporation has successfully sold many bulk-shaped items, from creatures to vehicles.The history of legosIn the late 1940s, the company formed a machine producing the plastic plane, which was regarded as a major version. This particular edition generated a new line of plastic stations that freely paid the business. Then, in 1949, the real Lego team produced the first thing in history, Automatic Union Bricks. Although these are not Lego bricks we have today, these developments have become the way to become a modern Lego. Also in size, style, and function, Integration with a large automated Rock has been customized by the organization. In 1954, the registered company LEGO as a trademark.When presenting huge rocks Suite Lego Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, Ole boy, who was now the executive energy agency, with the idea of establishing a game system according to his Lego stone. He selects the real shot of the view in the conversation had a buyer an alien device said that there was no real deal in the aircraft industry. This method produced the first models of Legos. The modern design and structure of the contemporary layout had copyright at the beginning of 1958, and it lasted five years to provide them with proper equipment. Surprisingly, the 1958 bricks still face modern blocks today.In the 1960s, LEGO was named the children and universal emotions. At the end of this 10th year, Lego property team was the extra Legos in which 42 nations all over the world have been in the style of Denmarks park which attracted more than half a million visitors in the first year. In the 1970s, Lego separated their children and childrens centers, school readers and senior entrepreneurs. This especially ten years has led to two significant developments in Lego: Lego traditional theme and world-famous legos, also known as figurines or even figurines. The organization continues to grow in the meteoric in the eighth and nineteenth years with expansion in the fields of education, sports, e-mail, published on the official website of Lego and the shops itself.In the 1990s, the organization brought one of its most significant risks, which generated large dividends. In 1999, Lego began to use licenses to promote its products. Star Wars, its first certified exhibit will be recorded for the organization. Since Lego offers smart integration with a series of icons and animated film producing theme models, Lego Batman, Harry Potter Legos, Spongebob Lego Indiana Jones Lego, Lego Spiderman, Toy Story Lego and more.LEGOs true organizationToday, LEGOs rights organization continues to grow. In addition to continuous certification contracts, the organization focuses on developing characters and models. Also, they are focusing on new opportunities for journalists, through the introduction of online games, video games, and three attractive DesignByMe, which has an online system offering Lego fans the chance to design and create their own Lego.

Kissinger, Secretary of State and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Amb. William Macomber, United States Ambassador to Turkey Joseph J. Sisco, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Arthur Hartman, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Peter W. Rodman, National Security Council Staff TIME AND DATE: Monday, March 10, 1975 5:20 - 6:30 p.m. PLACE: The Foreign Minister's Office Ankara, Turkey SUBJECTS: Aid Cut-off; Cyprus Esenbel: This used to be a Cabinet room. Now there is a bigger one downstairs. [Photographers are let in.] In Ankara there are about six papers. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 2 - Esenbel: Yes. Well, I welcome you here to Ankara, Mr. Secretary. It is a long time that we have been planning for this visit. We have long hoped you could make it. It is useful that we exchange views so we know where we stand on these two matters -- the military aid matter in Washington and your exchange of views with Bitsios. Kissinger: Mr. Foreign Minister, I want to express appreciation that you receive me, first, on short notice, and second in a time that is not easy in our relationship, when the U.S. Congress has taken an action which is totally wrong and with which we totally disagree. I appreciate it. I wanted to come after all my exchange with Bitsios because there are certain developments which I believe come a little closer to the Turkish point of view. With respect to the aid matter: I am at your disposal if you wish to discuss the subject. I understand you had a talk with my colleagues [Hartman and Macomber] this morning. Aid Cut-off Esenbel: Yes. On aid we said that we face heavy pressure -- not demonstrations or the usual, but you must realize how difficult it is to face up to these pressures -- from the parties and the intelligentsia and the military. We tell them that the U.S. Congress seems to understand their mistake. But you must realize there is a limit to what the Government can do. The time limit is approaching. We have a government crisis now, so maybe there are some additional days for this, but soon the question will come up again. The press started to criticize me this morning instead of you. Kissinger: If someone has to be criticized, that is a good solution. [Laughter] Esenbel: The people want some action. This is what was wrong with the Congressional action -- really they didn't care about Turkish sensitivities. They certainly destroyed something here and they didn't care. This is the crucial point -- that they could do it without caring about the people. It's not a money question. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 3 - Kissinger: No, I understand. Esenbel: That they say ""Make progress and come back in sixty days."" This is completely wrong. Kissinger: Mr. Foreign Minister, I needn't tell you what my sentiments are.. I have said publicly that we are giving aid to Turkey not as a favor to Turkey but because it serves our mutual interests. I said this at the airport. I remember, even if the Congressmen don't, that Turkey sent troops to Korea, an area where Turkey had no interest, and whose prisoners -- we had a study made -- were the only ones who never cooperated with the Koreans, and the North Koreans are very brutal. Just as aid to Turkey got us into international affairs, the cutoff can be a way to get us out of international affairs. It wasn't directed against Turkey -- it was an attempt to destroy our foreign policy. It reflects, in my view, deep-seated attitudes, and is not anti-Turkey. I believe we can change this. But because the people attacking it are attacking our whole foreign policy, it will be more difficult. If we had a secret vote, we could get it reversed. The problem now is how people can admit that they were wrong six weeks after the initial vote. It's a problem of political prestige for some. I hope you will look at it as the sickness of an old friend, not as something directed against Turkey. And show some patience. Strangely, in America I'm accused of what you are -- that my actions are encouraging you. That if it were not for me, you'd have done what they asked. As Bill Macomber told you, we have introduced legislation and hope to get it passed in a couple of weeks. Macomber: In the Senate. Kissinger: I believe if we can give some of the people who feel guilty an excuse to change their minds, we would have a fairly easy task. If we could. As soon as I finish the current negotiation in the Middle East, maybe in two weeks, I'll bring Bill back and we'll make a massive effort. We have had a legal analysis done, according to which it might be possible to restore spare parts more quickly if the President and the leadership cooperate. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 4 - Esenbel: A waiver. Kissinger: No it's a special authority for MAP, for up to $50 million. The difficulty is that if we use that waiver, they might not repeal the law. And we can use it only for one year. And next year we may not have the law changed. Therefore the President is very reluctant to do that. The only way to use the waiver is if the President with the tacit approval of the leaders and of the Greek lobby .. the Greek lobby may next year go after the waiver. But if you're under a tremendous time pressure, we may want to use the waiver. Therefore I wanted to explain the choice we have. Esenbel: You explained that before. You said that is the easiest road maybe, and the legislation would remain. And the Congressmen are reluctant to seem to admit the action was wrong, and then they'll say, ""Why the problem? They have the $50 million."" We agree with you; we're against it. And we don't want that. Kissinger: Thank you. I appreciate it. Esenbel: Aid is a long-term need. Aid is a substantial part of our relationship. We want this to be restored. We're not interested in aid programs of 40 days, 50 days -- not that kind of relationship. Kissinger: I agree with you. Esenbel: We want to know where we're standing. So people know they can trust the United States as an ally, and erase all doubts. With these 40-day waivers, we can't do that. Kissinger: The waiver wouldn't be 40 days but for a year. But you're morally right; aid should be restored. I know the President would prefer to restore aid for many reasons -- one, for the principle, and second, he doesn't want to be dependent on Mr. Brademas, letting Brademas say he's helped and then go back to his original line. He's prepared to just declare that progress has been made, if he's going to bend the law. He wants the principle to be restored, and he's prepared to make an all-out effort. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 5 - Esenbel: We approached the Europeans and Luns and he's supposed to come forward with an answer. Kissinger: We approached the Germans. Did they start? Yavuzalp: Not hardware; only subsidiary items. This has nothing to do with the spare parts we need. Kissinger: [to Hartman] Art, can you go to Bonn and see Genscher and Leber? And see Haig. Esenbel: You should brief Ecevit. Kissinger: Ecevit can be very helpful. Art will see the Germans on the way home and also see Haig to see about getting surplus parts out of stocks. And [Ambassador David] Bruce was helpful. Esenbel: The Europeans should find ways to meet quick needs; for example, the Air Force needs spare parts. For other items that they can't find in the stocks, maybe you could make a deal with the Dutch or others to send it here. Macomber: That is illegal. Kissinger: Before the Freedom of Information Act, I used to say at meetings, ""The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer."" [laughter] But since the Freedom of Information Act, I'm afraid to say things like that. We'll make a major effort. Esenbel: Your Ambassador told me the opposite. In Germany they said they delayed it one week so it looks like it happens after your visit. Kissinger: My understanding is that the aid is now in force. They informed us. Yavuzalp: The political decision is made, they say, but they're waiting for ""appropriate timing"" for implementation of the political decision. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 6 - Kissinger: [to Hartman] Talk to Genscher and say I attach enormous importance to that. Esenbel: The difficulty is they signed an agreement but they don't go ahead and implement it -- they do it piecemeal. Kissinger: I'm sending Art to Bonn. If there are difficulties, I'll consider stopping in Bonn. Yavuzalp: Our ambassador would be aware of the latest. Hartman: In Bonn. Yavuzalp: In Bonn. Kissinger: We have to do it somewhat quietly, so there shouldn't be news stories. [Secretary Kissinger confers with Ambassador Macomber] One more word about aid. In the nature of things, it will take us some time. It will take us two weeks in the Senate, and then some time to see where we stand in the House. Macomber: And there is a recess, so if we don't get it in two weeks, it will take two more before they reconvene. Kissinger: It is not possible before April. If we succeed in the Middle East, it will give me a lot of influence even though it has nothing to do with it. And if the Cyprus thing goes the way it might go, it would be more possible.The law might lapse automatically if there is a settlement. So we might just declare substantial progress and fight rather with the Congress over the finding of substantial progress. That we can consider in April. [Each side confers.] Esenbel: As the Secretary General reminds me, time is really pressing. We're enjoying a few days when the opposition doesn't want to shake us, but when the Government is formed, it will start. The people feel that the NATO Treaty Article III says that allies should help each other and not embargo each other, which is something done to an enemy. And the US is supplying arms to 100 countries and has put an embargo to Turkey. And if there is too much delay, they will lose their patience. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 7 - Elekdag: They see it as a punishment to Turkey for not following the policy line of the United States. This is how public opinion sees it. They are a little lenient now, but when the Government is formed, there will be a burst. How can the US do this with Turkey, a faithful ally? The intelligentsia see it as an unwritten law of NATO that there should not be an embargo on military sales. Kissinger: I agree with you. I'm not your problem. I fought against it before it was put on, and I'm fighting against it now. There are three options: One is to apply a waiver, but that would make it harder to change the law. Whenever your political pressures get too great, you can ask us. Second, we can find substantial progress under the existing law. This may be possible because, strangely, the Greeks have been making concessions, not the Turks. The third is to change the law. If your domestic situation gets too complex, you can tell Bill. To change the law, it requires talking to Congressmen; that will take Bill, Art, and myself. So there is the legislative calendar. And we don't want a negative vote. So these are the complexities. If your situation gets too complex, we can do a waiver. If we do it, we should do it for less than $50 million, so it's not seen as a substitute for changing the law. We should limit it to the essential parts. Esenbel: You say a smaller amount is preferable. Then it won't have any effect here. I'm supposing we won't do it by a waiver. Kissinger: I haven't thought it through. You can tell us what you need. We don't think it's a good way to proceed. The President doesn't. Esenbel: We don't like it either. Our military told us they don't like it. You should work on the Senate. Our people tell us to talk to Javits. One of our Senators met him and talked to him. He said, ""I'm a friend of Turkey. Are you a politician or a diplomat?"" Our Senator said he was a politician. Javits said, ""So am I and I have to vote against it."" Kissinger: But we're beginning to turn that around. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 8 - Esenbel: I talked to Rosenthal in his office and lost two hours with Rosenthal. He said he needed to ""tilt"" toward Caramanlis. He said, ""I have to give something."" Kissinger: But that was last fall. Esenbel: That's worrisome, that they can think so lightly of Turkey. Kissinger: It has nothing to do with Turkey. It was the result of the unusual conditions of last year -- the result of Watergate, of an unelected President and in an election period, when all were terrified. So I think it's a mistake to take it as against Turkey. What would have happened normally would be a sense of Congress resolution, and we'd ignore it. I think it ran away with him. Macomber: They didn't think it would pass. Kissinger: That's another thing. They thought it would pass and we'd veto it and it would stand. But it happened just after the President had pardoned President Nixon. Now we need a way to help them find a way to reverse themselves. The mood as late as January was very bad. The mood now is defensive. Macomber: You're absolutely right, sir. The mood in the Senate is shifting; you can feel it. In the House, it's not so noticeable. In the House, the leadership is for a change. But the problem is how these people can explain a turnaround. CYPRUS Kissinger: Let's talk a few minutes of Cyprus. Without your making concessions, perhaps we can show progress and they can say they're helping progress. Let me say this on Cyprus. We have spent our previous discussions of Cyprus perhaps not on the fundamental problems. We talked about Famagusta airport. This was partly because of Congress; we wanted to show progress. But as you've said, the heart of the problem is the administrative structure of Cyprus, and perhaps in that framework the solution to the other problems can be found. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 9 - My impression -- this is not a Greek message but my impression -- is that we could persuade the Greeks to accept a bizonal solution if your area is reduced in size. They are worried that if the Greek area is so small, it would lead to a massive exodus from the island. Which would lead to  a political impossibility for the Greek government. They have not yet said they would accept a bizonal solution, but my impression is they could be convinced to move in that direction if the area could be reduced. Bitsios talked especially of the Morphou area and of the areas south of the Famagusta-Nicosia road. South of the old road, between the lower and upper road. I didn't press it. He did point out, however, that while he wants the Morphou area, there is a Turkish population west of Kyrenia. Esenbel: Lefka. Kissinger: Lefka, which would clearly have to be part of the Turkish zone. So it's my impression from talking to Bitsios that he wants the negotiation to start again. And he wants the negotiations to start outside of Nicosia -- for reasons we all agree on. That's his interest in the UN -- whether it's New York, Vienna or Geneva. He prefers New York, but that's a secondary question. For the first time, I detected a willingness to discuss a bizonal  rather, that his mind was moving in that direction. But it was related to the reduction of the territory. Our Ambassador has that impression. With respect to Makarios as President of that new Government, it is not out of the question that a proposition could be made to the Greeks. If this is possible, then it is in everyone's interest to drop the secondary issues and see whether it can be settled. Then Turkey would get international recognition of your basic position -- a bizonal solution. If the area is reduced -- you're the best judge. And the basic structure of the island. And the other issues could then perhaps more easily be settled. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 10 - This is why I asked to come here. If you ask them flatly now -- ""Do you accept a bizonal solution?"" they'll say no. But I think it can be moved in that direction. And you should think whether it would be better to remove this from the international agenda. Makarios' strategy is obvious -- he wants the Russians in. We have received a letter from Brezhnev which we have not answered in three weeks, asking for internationalization. If it comes to that, the technique would be impossible. This isn't my proposal to you; it's my impression of the Greek position. The curious thing is that the aid cutoff has made the Greeks more flexible, not the Turks. [Laughter] It's a paradox but it's the result. If a negotiation in that framework could get started, rather than waive the law we could just say that substantial progress has been made. It would take a lot of nerve for the Congress to defy us. And the Greeks would have reason to be cautious, because if it's cut off and you walk out, they get nothing. I talked to Clerides. I can speak to his view more certainly. I believe he would go along with this. It would be a totally different Congressional situation if the obstacle were Makarios. We would see very early on in the negotiation whether the Greeks would accept a bizonal solution; if the obstacle is Makarios. I'm having a memorandum prepared -- we're speaking as friends -- of the Greek Cypriot press. If it's Makarios against the US, that we can handle domestically. You needn't decide now. We're not pressing you. I have the impression that Caramanlis wants a rapid solution. I told Bitsios that any solution will be worse for Greece. I said, ""The longer you wait, the more you make it a domestic issue. The only differences are a little more or a little less; whatever you get, your critics can still accuse you of a bad agreement."" He said, ""I agree with you."" Our Ambassador saw Caramanlis yesterday afternoon, and Caramanlis agreed with this analysis. Therefore what I say to you is in my judgment achievable with the Greek Government. Caramanlis did make the point that beyond a certain point it would be unmanageable for him -- for example, if there was a mass exodus from the island, it would be a disaster for him. So it has to be enough for the Greek population to live in. SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 11 - I said I didn't know whether the Turks would accept Makarios as President. Of course, at one point you asked for his return. [Laughter] [A map of Cyprus is brought out and placed on the table. Secretary Kissinger indicates on the map:] Here, below the road, between the old road and the new road, he said he needed something. Below the old road. He showed me something on the map but I didn't take it down because I didn't think this was for me to negotiate. He didn't say that was all, but he did mention those two areas. Plus if it causes an exodus. He didn't say the whole area between the roads. Esenbel: Did he mean negotiations between Clerides and Denktash or between us? Kissinger: He said he needed an excuse to resume the talks after you declared this [autonomous state]. So he can't go back to the same talks. This is his interest in the UN. So his idea is for you to meet over the Aegean, and of course while you and he meet on the Aegean no one can keep you from talking about something else. But he can't meet on the Aegean until the other talks start. He agrees it shouldn't be internationalized. He said the trend toward war, even though it would be disastrous, would be hard to avoid if there is no solution. He didn't want it -- and this was not said in a threatening way. He realizes it would be a disaster for Greece. Esenbel: That is one point we agree on -- the last point. [Laughter] Kissinger: I asked our Ambassador to check my analysis with him, and at the end he said Esenbel: We hope the talks will be resumed and we checked with your Ambassador and Mr. Hartman. Kissinger: What is happening in New York? SECRET/NODIS/XGDS SECRET/NODIS/XGDS - 12 - Esenbel: They're meeting now. We hope there will be a resolution to ask the Secretary General to convene the talks somewhere. We hope not in New York. Kissinger: What do you have against New York? I'm not pushing it. Esenbel: It shouldn't be under the United Nations nor should the UN be involved; it should be something solved by the people of Cyprus. I talked to the Secretary General and he agreed. Kissinger: What about Vienna? Esenbel: Yes, we proposed Vienna. His man can attend, as Weckmann did. Sisco: In light of what the Secretary said, it is all the more important to get something settled in New York. Kissinger: Given Waldheim's vanity, it will be hard to keep him out of the talks. [Laughter] Given his general level of competence, what damage can he do? [Laughter] Esenbel: He was jotting down my words. Kissinger: We have sent a message to Bitsios this morning that we want something worked out on the basis of a consensus with Turkey. We couldn't get directly involved in the drafting because we would be always behind events. But Buffum is instructed to work constructively. Esenbel: We will meet tomorrow. Kissinger: The difficulty will be -- [bear this in mind] when you gentlemen consult among yourselves -- the Greeks can't accept a bizonal arrangement unless the area is reduced. If you ask them now if they accept a bizonal solution, they'll say no. But if we can combine them some way so that when they agree to a bizonal arrangement they'll have some assurance of a reduction of the area.

She doesnt like to be touched by strangers. OK, no sweaty handshakes. Fair enough. But theres more. If you get nervous around Roseanne, try not to show it. Shes like a shark. If she smells fear, shell tear you apart, the makeup artist says.As I wait for Barr to arrive, I contemplate the pop culture folklore that surrounds her: the alleged multiple personality disorder, the roller coaster relationship with Tom Arnoldwhich culminated in a bitter divorcethe theory (her own) that she may in fact be the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, whom she has requested to be dressed as for her Heeb photo shoot. Nervous doesnt begin to describe my feelings about meeting this 54 Jewish grandmother.With her hit sitcom off the air for more than a decade and the tabloid pages of her tumultuous life rotting in landfills, Barr currently spends her time working on a collection of essays on menopause, celebrity, pharmaceuticals and Jewish life in Mormon Utah (to be published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment) and disseminating her signature mix of insights and insults through her blog (Roseanneworld.com). She briefly kept an account with what she now calls that shit heap (Twitter) before deleting it, citing as her reason the idiocy of people and how ill-informed they all seem. Today, when she brusquely enters the photo studio, she seems none too happy about having been dragged from her self-imposed exile.Hello, she barks in a general greeting to everyone and no one. I approach with the kind of caution usually reserved for wild animals and salute her with a Sieg Heil in honor of our shoot. She looks at me blankly and asks, Who are you? I do my best to explain, then abruptly break the second Roseanne commandment: Sorry, Im a bit nervous, I stammer. The second the words are out of my mouth I brace myself for the onslaught, but to my surprise I seem to have amused her and Barr softens into the loving, if somewhat irritated, matriarch who charmed a generation.As the Domestic Goddess dons the famous moustache, transforming into Domestic Goddess Hitler, I notice that shes beginning to have fun. She nails the Fuehrers facial expressions with twisted glee, and as she takes the burnt gingerbread Jew Cookies out of the oven it occurs to me that Barr may be the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fucka quality theoretically easy to embody until its time to face the practical repercussions. Franklin Ajae, Paul Mooney, Mort Sahl and Dick Gregorys passings will tear my kishkas out, Barr laments. They gave everything they had to just tell the truth, and they couldnt make a decent living because of the choice they madenot selling out to Hollywood.At 55 years old, truth is the key governing principal to Barr. Yes, she has plastic in her past, but she has since rejected the idea of staving off the aging process. In fact, clinging to youth now seems downright disgusting to her. Todays youth make me rejoice in being a germ-obsessed hermit, she confides. The thought of young people doing it is repulsive to me. However, this does not mean the lovable curmudgeon doesnt know how to party. I have the pleasure of drinking too much in my post-menopausal incarnation, she reveals. I like tequila, really expensive kinds straightup. I hate alcoholics and AA If you cant drink responsibly, dont drink at all. Dont go to meetings, whine about your character flaws and blame the fact that you are a sociopath on booze. Barr also supports legalizing marijuana and has plenty of theories on the subject. Kraft Foods invented pot. You have to realize that its a spiritual hunger, not a material hunger, that you are feeling, she says.As we wrap up the shoot, Barr puts her Swastika armband, one of the gingerbread victims and a Polaroid of herself in the costume in a Ziploc bag, making it look like evidence from some bizarre crime scene. She plans on bringing it to her 13-year-old son when she picks him up from school. Maybe this will make my kid like me, she says with a sigh.When the photographer suggests that we pose together for a quick snapshot, I put my arm around this slightly eccentric drinker and pot smoker who gets off on dressing like a Nazi, and it dawns on me: I adore her. No-touching protocol be damned, I lean in to plant a kiss on her cheek, and, to my surprise, she turns toward me and puckers her lips. The nerves Im feeling now are of a completely different variety.Click for more of Roseannes insight and of course pictures, including the above mentioned Polaroid.Read Heeb publisher, Josh Neumans response to all the fuss over the photo on the Internet.",That Oven Feelin  Heeb,,High School Dropout Oliver Noble Has Managed To Parlay His Los Angeles Internship With A Coke Whore Into Creating Tasteless Works Which That Have Been Featured In Heeb,right,right,n,,143,

NPS Photo Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio; the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison. When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen. Edison had very little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few months. He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own. This belief in self-improvement remained throughout his life. Edison began working at an early age, as most boys did at the time. At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy, selling newspapers and candy on the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit. He seems to have spent much of his free time reading scientific, and technical books, and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to operate a telegraph. By the time he was sixteen, Edison was proficient enough to work as a telegrapher full time. The development of the telegraph was the first step in the communication revolution, and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. This rapid growth gave Edison and others like him a chance to travel, see the country, and gain experience. Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United States before arriving in Boston in 1868. Here Edison began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor. He received his first patent on an electric vote recorder, a device intended for use by elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process. This invention was a commercial failure. Edison resolved that in the future he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want. Edison moved to New York City in 1869. He continued to work on inventions related to the telegraph, and developed his first successful invention, an improved stock ticker called the ""Universal Stock Printer"". For this and some related inventions Edison was paid $40,000. This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark, New Jersey in 1871. During the next five years, Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph. He also found to time to get married to Mary Stilwell and start a family. In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park, twenty-five miles southwest of New York City. Edison established a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention. This research and development laboratory was the first of its kind anywhere; the model for later, modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories, this is sometimes considered to be Edison's greatest invention. Here Edison began to change the world. Edison's first phonograph - 1877. NPS Photo The first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the tin foil phonograph. The first machine that could record and reproduce sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame. Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph, and was invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford B. Hayes in April 1878. Edison next undertook his greatest challenge, the development of a practical incandescent, electric light. The idea of electric lighting was not new, and a number of people had worked on, and even developed forms of electric lighting. But up to that time, nothing had been developed that was remotely practical for home use. Edison's eventual achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light, but also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements necessary to make the incandescent light practical, safe, and economical. After one and a half years of work, success was achieved when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread burned for thirteen and a half hours. The first public demonstration of the Edison's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879, when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted. Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry. In September 1882, the first commercial power station, located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan, went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area; the electric age had begun. An early sketch from a laboratory notebook of an electric lightbulb. NPS Photo The success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of fame and wealth, as electricity spread around the world. Edison's various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were brought together to form Edison General Electric. Despite the use of Edison in the company title however, Edison never controlled this company. The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of investment bankers such as J.P. Morgan. When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson-Houston in 1892, Edison was dropped from the name, and the company became simply General Electric. This period of success was marred by the death of Edison's wife Mary in 1884. Edison's involvement in the business end of the electric industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park. After Mary's death, Edison was there even less, living instead in New York City with his three children. A year later, while vacationing at a friends house in New England, Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love. The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange, New Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate, Glenmont, for his bride. Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death. When Edison moved to West Orange, he was doing experimental work in makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. A few months after his marriage, however, Edison decided to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself, less than a mile from his home. Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this time to build, ""the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development of an invention "". The new laboratory complex consisting of five buildings opened in November 1887. A three story main laboratory building contained a power plant, machine shops, stock rooms, experimental rooms and a large library. Four smaller one story buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics lab, chemistry lab, metallurgy lab, pattern shop, and chemical storage. The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to work on any sort of project, but also allowed him to work on as many as ten or twenty projects at once. Facilities were added to the laboratory or modified to meet Edison's changing needs as he continued to work in this complex until his death in 1931. Over the years, factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the laboratory. The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually covered more than twenty acres and employed 10,000 people at its peak during World War One (1914-1918). After opening the new laboratory, Edison began to work on the phonograph again, having set the project aside to develop the electric light in the late 1870s. By the 1890s, Edison began to manufacture phonographs for both home, and business use. Like the electric light, Edison developed everything needed to have a phonograph work, including records to play, equipment to record the records, and equipment to manufacture the records and the machines. In the process of making the phonograph practical, Edison created the recording industry. The development and improvement of the phonograph was an ongoing project, continuing almost until Edison's death. While working on the phonograph, Edison began working on a device that, ""does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear"", this was to become motion pictures. Edison first demonstrated motion pictures in 1891, and began commercial production of ""movies"" two years later in a peculiar looking structure, built on the laboratory grounds, known as the Black Maria. Like the electric light and phonograph before it, Edison developed a complete system, developing everything needed to both film and show motion pictures. Edison's initial work in motion pictures was pioneering and original. However, many people became interested in this third new industry Edison created, and worked to further improve on Edison's early motion picture work. There were therefore many contributors to the swift development of motion pictures beyond the early work of Edison. By the late 1890s, a thriving new industry was firmly established, and by 1918 the industry had become so competitive that Edison got out of the movie business all together. The success of the phonograph and motion pictures in the 1890s helped offset the greatest failure of Edison's career. Throughout the decade Edison worked in his laboratory and in the old iron mines of northwestern New Jersey to develop methods of mining iron ore to feed the insatiable demand of the Pennsylvania steel mills. To finance this work, Edison sold all his stock in General Electric. Despite ten years of work and millions of dollars spent on research and development, Edison was never able to make the process commercially practical, and lost all the money he had invested. This would have meant financial ruin had not Edison continued to develop the phonograph and motion pictures at the same time. As it was, Edison entered the new century still financially secure and ready to take on another challenge. Edison's new challenge was to develop a better storage battery for use in electric vehicles. Edison very much enjoyed automobiles and owned a number of different types during his life, powered by gasoline, electricity, and steam. Edison thought that electric propulsion was clearly the best method of powering cars, but realized that conventional lead-acid storage batteries were inadequate for the job. Edison began to develop an alkaline battery in 1899. It proved to be Edison's most difficult project, taking ten years to develop a practical alkaline battery. By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery, the gasoline powered car had so improved that electric vehicles were becoming increasingly less common, being used mainly as delivery vehicles in cities. However, the Edison alkaline battery proved useful for lighting railway cars and signals, maritime buoys, and miners lamps. Unlike iron ore mining, the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely, and the storage battery eventually became Edison's most profitable product. Further, Edison's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery. By 1911, Thomas Edison had built a vast industrial operation in West Orange. Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory, and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands. To better manage operations, Edison brought all the companies he had started to make his inventions together into one corporation, Thomas A. Edison Incorporated, with Edison as president and chairman. Edison was sixty-four by this time and his role with his company and in life began to change. Edison left more of the daily operations of both the laboratory and the factories to others. The laboratory itself did less original experimental work and instead worked more on refining existing Edison products such as the phonograph. Although Edison continued to file for and receive patents for new inventions, the days of developing new products that changed lives and created industries were behind him. In the 1915, Edison was asked to head the Naval Consulting Board. With the United States inching closer towards the involvement in World War One, the Naval Consulting Board was an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces. Edison favored preparedness, and accepted the appointment. The Board did not make a notable contribution to the final allied victory, but did serve as a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists, inventors and the United States military. During the war, at age seventy, Edison spent several months on Long Island Sound in a borrowed navy vessel experimenting on techniques for detecting submarines. Edison's role in life began to change from inventor and industrialist to cultural icon, a symbol of American ingenuity, and a real life Horatio Alger story. In 1928, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement, the United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor. In 1929 the nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light. The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village, Ford's new American history museum, which included a complete restoration of the Menlo Park Laboratory. Attendees included President Herbert Hoover and many of the leading American scientists and inventors. The last experimental work of Edison's life was done at the request of Edison's good friends Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone in the late 1920s. They asked Edison to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires. The natural rubber used for tires up to that time came from the rubber tree, which does not grow in the United States. Crude rubber had to be imported and was becoming increasingly expensive. With his customary energy and thoroughness, Edison tested thousands of different plants to find a suitable substitute, eventually finding a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible. Edison was still working on this at the time of his death. During the last two years of his life Edison was in increasingly poor health. Edison spent more time away from the laboratory, working instead at Glenmont. Trips to the family vacation home in Fort Myers, Florida became longer. Edison was past eighty and suffering from a number of ailments. In August 1931 Edison collapsed at Glenmont. Essentially house bound from that point, Edison steadily declined until at 3:21 am on October 18, 1931 the great man died.",Thomas Edison National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service),,,context,context,n,,145,

When he applied for asylum, since polygamy is prohibited in Germany, he had to choose which of the four women to become his main wife, in order to ensure to all his children social benefits that the state provides to refugees.Ghazia chose his wife Twasif as his official wife, along with the 5 children he had by her. According to German law, Ghazias other wives are classified as  partners  but the man insists that he treats them all equally.According to our religion I have a duty to visit every family in the same way and do not prioritize any of them, Ghazia said, meaning that he often must leave home to visit his other wives, who all live within a 30-mile radius of the man. All of his 23 children but onea daughter now married and living in Saudi Arabiaare settled in Germany.A local official in the town of Montabaur described Ghazias benefit situation as an exemption.Ghazias story has provoked a strong reaction among many Germans, who are protesting the level of benefits enjoyed by the refugee.The estimated sum of 360 thousand euros per year comes from a German financial manager who posted the figure on the website of the Association of Employers as an approximative calculation of what the German state would be paying for the whole family.For his part, Ghazia claims he would like to work but his familial burdens make it impossible. Back in Syria the man reportedly earned enough money with his car sharing and car service business to cover the expenses of his large family.Now he spends his time visiting his various families, he says.","Germany: Muslim Migrant with Four Wives and 23 Children Receives $390,000 a Year in Benefits",10/26/16,,right,right,n,,147,

Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKenna is heading the DOE team; former Interior Department solicitor David Bernhardt is leading the effort for that agency, according to sources close to the campaign.Ebell is a well-known and polarizing figure in the energy and environment realm. His participation in the EPA transition signals that the Trump team is looking to drastically reshape the climate policies the agency has pursued under the Obama administration. Ebell's role is likely to infuriate environmentalists and Democrats but buoy critics of Obama's climate rules.Ebell, who was dubbed an ""elegant nerd"" and a ""policy wonk"" by Vanity Fair, is known for his prolific writings that question what he calls climate change ""alarmism."" He appears frequently in the media and before Congress. He's also chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group of nonprofits that ""question global warming alarmism and oppose energy-rationing policies.""Ebell appears to relish criticism from the left.In a biography submitted when he testified before Congress, he listed among his recognitions that he had been featured in a Greenpeace ""Field Guide to Climate Criminals,"" dubbed a ""misleader"" on global warming by Rolling Stone and was the subject of a motion to censure in the British House of Commons after Ebell criticized the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser for his views on global warming.More recently, Ebell has called the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan for greenhouse gases illegal and said that Obama joining the Paris climate treaty ""is clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate's authority.""AdvertisementHe told Vanity Fair in 2007, ""There has been a little bit of warming ... but it's been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it's caused by human beings or not, it's nothing to worry about.""Ebell's views appear to square with Trump's when it comes to EPA's agenda. Trump has called global warming ""bullshit"" and he has said he would ""cancel"" the Paris global warming accord and roll back President Obama's executive actions on climate change (ClimateWire, May 27).Leading the Trump DOE team: GOP hired gun McKenna.The president of MWR Strategies is well known in Republican energy circles. He was director of policy and external affairs for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality under then-Gov. George Allen (R) and was an external relations specialist at the Energy Department during the George H.W. Bush administration.His lobbying clients in 2016 include Koch Companies Public Sector LLC, Southern Company Services, Dow Chemical Co. and Competitive Power Ventures Inc., according to public disclosures.And heading Interior's transition effort is Bernhardt, co-chairman of the Natural Resources Department at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.He served as Interior's solicitor during the George W. Bush administration after holding several other high-ranking jobs at the department.In addition to the EPA, Interior and DOE team leaders, GOP energy expert Mike Catanzaro is also working on energy policy for the Trump transition team (Greenwire, Sept. 14).During the Obama transition in 2008, a relatively small team was assembled ahead of the election in order to map out broad policy goals.Following the election, the operation expanded dramatically and teams were dispatched to work out of agencies to gather information from political staffers and career officials, write flurries of memos and compile thick binders of intelligence to hand over to the incoming leadership (Greenwire, Aug. 19, 2016).Should Trump win in November, Ebell, McKenna and Bernhardt will likely be leading similar efforts to reform their respective agencies.Ebell and McKenna directed questions about their roles to the Trump transition team. The Trump campaign and Bernhardt did not respond to requests for comment.This story also appears in ClimateWire.",CAMPAIGN 2016: Trump picks top skeptic to lead EPA transition,,,right,right,n,,150,
TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dogs-jealousy-study/,Did a Study Show That Dogs Exhibit Jealousy?,Science  Critter Country,06-Feb-18,A study showed that dogs could show jealousy if they caught their owners behaving sweetly toward other dogs.,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094597,1,TRUE,No Error,"It is commonly assumed that jealousy is unique to humans, partially because of the complex cognitions often involved in this emotion. However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some primordial form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans.As discussed earlier, the proposed function of jealousy is to break-up a potentially threatening liaison and protect the primary relationship. This motivates several types of behaviors including approach actions such as attempts to get physically or psychologically between the attachment 3ure and the interloper, attending to the threatening interaction, seeking attention from the attachment figure, as well as indicators of negative emotion such as aggression, particularly toward the interloper [1]  [2] , [8] , [10]  [12] , [19] . Across social species, we would expect to see similar types of behaviors that serve the function of this motivational state. Therefore, the specific behaviors assessed in our experiment were based on studies of jealousy in non-verbal human infants and adults as well as behaviors described by dog owners and experts as indicative of jealousy.To evaluate dogs' jealous behaviors, we modified a paradigm used to assess jealousy in 6-month-old infants [10]  [12] . Thirty-six dogs were individually tested and videotaped while their owners ignored them and interacted with a series of three different objects. In the jealousy condition, the owner treated a stuffed dog, which briefly barked and wagged its tail, as if it were a real dog (e.g., petting, talking sweetly). In another condition, owners engaged in these same behaviors but did so towards a novel object (jack-o-lantern pail). This enabled us to test whether the elicitation of jealousy required that the owner show affection to an appropriate stimulus (what appeared to be a conspecific) or whether affectionate behaviors directed to a nonsocial stimulus would be enough to arouse jealous behaviors. In the third condition, the owner read aloud a children's book, which had pop-up pages and played melodies. This condition allowed us to test whether dogs' behaviors in the other conditions were indicative of jealousy per se (arising over the loss of affection and attention towards an interloper) or more general negative affect due to the loss of the owner's attention.Although there are several reasons to predict that jealousy should lie within a dog's emotional repertoire, empirical evidence is lacking. The purpose of the present study was to construct a social situation and determine whether dogs, whose owners show affection to a potential interloper, engage in behaviors indicative of jealousy.The idea that dogs are capable of jealousy is congenial to the burgeoning body of research on animal social cognition that reveals that dogs have sophisticated social-cognitive abilities. For example, dogs can use a variety of human communicative signals (e.g., pointing, eye gaze) to determine the location of hidden food [16] , are better at using social cues than chimpanzees [16] , show some sensitivity to reward inequity when a partner is rewarded and they are not [17] and appear aware of, and actively attempt to manipulate, the visual attention of their play partners [18] .The functional account we are proposing would further predict that jealousy should occur not only in humans, but also in other social species in which emotional bonds between individuals develop and can be threatened by third parties. Interestingly, several observers of animal behavior, including Charles Darwin [13] , have suggested that jealousy may exist in other species, particularly in dogs. This possibility has also been underscored in a recent paper that had owners recount specific cases of their animals displaying emotions [14] . Descriptions of dog jealousy were fairly consistent across owners and always involved a social triangle. When the owners gave attention and affection to another person or animal, the dogs seemed to engage in attention-seeking behaviors (pushing against the owner or in between the owner and the rival, barking/growling/whining) and some showed aggression. Reports of the occurrence of jealousy in dogs was at least as common, if not more so, than some other emotions that are often considered more primary (anxiety and anger). However, despite such reports, experimental evidence demonstrating behavioral indices of jealousy in dogs does not exist. This type of empirical research seems particularly important, given that dog owners also report that their animals experience guilt but experimental work raises some doubt about whether dogs do show guilt [15] .The theory that jealousy can take a primordial form finds support from the small but emerging body of research on human infant jealousy. Several studies [10]  [12] found that infants as young as 6-months of age show behaviors indicative of jealousy, for example, when their mothers interacted with what appeared to be another infant (but was actually a realistic looking doll). The infants did not display the same behaviors when their mothers attend to a nonsocial item (a book).One possibility is that jealousy first evolved in the context of sibling-parent relationships where dependent offspring compete for parental resources. An implication of this hypothesis is that jealousy may have a primordial or core form that can be triggered without complex cognition about the self or about the meaning of the social interaction [1] , [9] . This primordial form of jealousy may be elicited by the relatively simple perception that an attachment figure or loved one's attention has been captured by a potential usurper, which suffices to elicit a motive to regain the loved one's attention and block the liaison. Primordial jealousy may serve as the building block for jealousy elicited by more complex cognitive processes. For example, in adult human relationships, the experience of jealousy is greatly impacted by additional appraisals about the meaning of the interaction (e.g., does this mean my mate will leave me? Am I unloveable?). In both primordial and complex cases of jealousy, there is a motivation to restore the relationship and remove the usurper. However, in the latter case, interpretations of the situation play a large role in the elicitation and experience of the emotion.The vast majority of research in this area has concentrated on jealousy within romantic relationships particularly over potential or actual infidelity. Hence, functional or evolutionary analysis of jealousy has focused on the fitness consequences of loss of a romantic or sexual relationship (e.g., cuckoldry, loss of resources) and on the psychological and behavioral effects of protecting such relationships [5]  [7] . A broader functional view, however, would argue that jealousy evolved to secure resources not just in the context of sexual relationships, but also in any of a wide-range of valued relationships [1] , [8] . Accordingly, the same underlying emotional process that gives rise to jealousy in sexual relationships also produces jealousy in other types of bonds (e.g., friendships).In humans, jealousy is an emotion with far-reaching psychological and social consequences. For example, it typically emerges as the third leading cause of non-accidental homicide across cultures [1] . While the origins and possible function of jealousy have been debated, most theorists agree on one defining feature: It requires a social triangle, arising when an interloper threatens an important relationship. A common assumption has been that the elicitation of jealousy involves, and perhaps requires, complex cognitive abilities [2]  [3] , including appraisals about the meaning of the rival threat to one's self (e.g., self-esteem) and to one's relationship. For example, Lewis [4] has proposed that the emergence of jealousy requires the cognitive ability to reflect on the self and to understand conscious intentions.In addition to assessing jealousy, we used this opportunity to explore attachment style in dogs (and its possible interaction with our conditions), which we mention here for the sake of completeness. We created a scale for owners to complete regarding their dog's attachment style and coded for behaviors that might be linked to different attachment styles. These included behaviors that might be indicative of anxiety (paw slightly raised; yawning) and of submission (ears back, tail down, and licking). We also attempted to code tail wagging to the left vs. the right because work by Quaranta, Siniscalchi, and Vallortigara [20] suggested that the former is associated with withdrawal and the latter with approach. However, our coders found this too difficult to assess via video. Analyses pertaining to attachment style are not reported here given their exploratory nature and the difficulty of measuring some of these behaviors.During the post-interaction period, the owner put the object down and walked away. We coded four behaviors during this phase: 1) aggression/snapping directed at the object; 2) following the owner; 3) observing the object; and 4) ignoring the object. Due to the laborious nature of coding, we only coded for presence/absence of attention behaviors (observing/ignoring object) in this phase rather than assessing attention every 5 seconds as done in the condition phase. Additionally, in the dog condition, we noted if the dog sniffed the rear end of the toy dog. This was included as a measure of whether the dog perceived the stuffed dog as a real dog.The preverbal human infant literature (e.g., by Hart and colleagues) suggests that jealousy produces increased interest and attention toward the mother. We assessed several behaviors pertaining to attention, which included 1) looking at the owner, 2) looking at the rival object, 3) orienting away from the owner, and 4) orienting away from the object. The first two categories were operationally defined as having the head turned and gaze directed toward the owner/object; the later two were operationally defined as having the head and body turned away from the owner/object. Due to their frequency across conditions, a simple present/absent code for the entire interaction period did not adequately capture these behaviors. Therefore, we performed more fined grained coding that consisted of denoting whether the behavior was present or absent every 5 seconds, resulting in total score that ranged from 012. Total scores were then transformed into proportion of time behavior was present. (In the cases where both raters coded the same dog's behavior, the average of the two coders' scores was used for these measures.)The most common category of behavior in owner descriptions of their dogs' jealousy was attention seeking [14] . These behaviors often took the form of pushing the owner or attempting to get between the owner and the rival. We coded for both of these behaviors. Some owners also reported attempts by their dogs to shoo the rival away. In our coding scheme, we operationalized this as the dog pushing against the rival object. Another class of behaviors categorized as attention seeking by Morris et al. [14] was vocalizations (described as barking, growling, and whining), which we assessed. (Growling interrater reliability was lower than our .7 cutoff so was excluded from our analyses.)We coded for aggression given its link to jealousy in human adults [1] and in owners' reports of dog jealousy [14] . Our primary measure of aggression was whether the dog attempted to bite/snap at the object. Coders also attempted to code more subtle signs of aggression that include lip curling (lips being held open with force in order to expose teeth), raised tailholding the tail up between the horizontal and vertical positions (an aggressive posture in wolves), and keeping the ears forward. Interrater reliability was low for ears forward (.57) and so this behavior was not analyzed. Our coders also reported difficulty assessing the raised tail in many dogs due to their physical characteristics (e.g., a clipped tail); however, interrater reliability was acceptable, so these analyses are reported in the results section. Lip curling was not seen across any condition.Two raters, blind to the study's purpose, coded the videos. Unless otherwise noted, behaviors were coded as present or absent and are reported as percent of dogs showing such behaviors per condition. To compute interrater reliability, 29 dogs were coded by both raters. Behaviors in which interrater reliability was lower than .7 were not included in the analyses. For analyses that required whole numbers (i.e., Cochran's Test for presence/absence of a behavior), we used one rater's codes for half the dogs and the other rater's codes for the other half. Behaviors coded during the interaction of the owner with the object are described first, followed by the behaviors coded post-interaction.In the book control condition, owners were instructed to read aloud a children's book, which popped up and played melodies, as if they were reading to a young child. Total amount of time the object made a noise was closely matched to that of the dog condition (approximately 8 secs).Owners were instructed to interact with a realistic-looking stuffed dog that barked, whined, and wagged its tail (which lasted for a total of approximately 8 secs) when a button on the top of its head was pressed. The owners were asked to press the button only once and to interact with the stuffed dog as if they were playing with a real dog. They were also instructed to completely ignore their dog, which was present in the room for the duration of the interaction.Owners were not aware of the hypotheses of the experiment. A within-subjects design was employed with order counter-balanced across participants. Each experimental condition was videotaped and lasted for 1 minute, followed by a 30 sec post-condition phase in which the owner set the object down within reach of the dog. The owner completed a questionnaire after each condition and then the dog and owner were given one minute to freely interact in order to reduce any potential carryover effects from the previous condition.The initial sample size was n = 37. However, one male dog was excluded from all analyses due to a miscommunication between the owner and experimenter resulting in one condition ending prematurely. Therefore, the final sample size was n = 36. The mean age of the dogs was 32.2 months (range = 4135). Equal numbers of male and female dogs participated. The sample consisted of a variety of dog breeds as can be seen in Table 1 . Owners (31 females and 5 males) had owned their dogs an average of 25.4 months (range = 1134).Dogs were tested individually at their homes and had to be less than 35 pounds or shorter than 15 inches. A size criterion was used because of the possibility that the jealousy manipulation would result in aggression and small dogs could be more easily controlled in such circumstances. Upon arrival at the subjects' homes, the experimenter obtained written consent from the dog owners for participation. The experimenter also gave a brief overview of the study stating, For this experiment, we are examining individual differences in dog behavior across various situations. Thus, we'll be asking you to act out various situations in front of your dog, while ignoring him or her, while we film his or her reaction."" The experimenter also said, ""If you think that your dog will act aggressively in this situation, we ask that you and your dog don't participate, but you'll still receive your Experimetrix [course] credit."" All owners chose to continue with the experiment.This research was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and by the University of California at San Diego Human Research Protections Program. Owners and pet dogs were recruited from the University of California, San Diego subject pool. Owners received partial course credit in psychology class for participation.Results & DiscussionFigure 1 shows the proportion of dogs that engaged in the various behaviors during the interactions with the objects in each condition. Our analyses showed significantly greater aggression in the jealousy condition, Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 12.80, p< .002. One fourth of the dogs snapped at the object in the jealousy condition but only 1 dog did so in the other two conditions. (Results from follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1.) We, however, did not see a difference across conditions in the number of dogs that placed their tails between the vertical and horizontal positions (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = .67, ns). This may be due to our coders having difficulty accurately assessing tail movement (e.g., in dogs with snipped tails). In the post-interaction phase (when the owner had put the object down), 36% of the dogs snapped at the stuffed dog while snapping behavior in the other conditions was confined to one dog (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.57, p< .001). The aggression in the jealousy condition is particularly impressive given that we only tested dogs whose owners believed that their dogs would not behave aggressively in novel situations.The next series of analyses examined attention seeking and specifically focused on the behaviors most commonly noted by owners when describing their animals' jealous behaviors [14]. Dogs were significantly more likely to push or touch their owners (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 26.87, p< .001) and the object (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 24.07, p< .001) in the jealousy condition relative to either the jack-o-lantern or book conditions. Results for follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1. Of particular interest, dogs specifically tried to get between the owner and the object more often in the jealousy condition (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.53, p< .04). Such behaviors aimed at preventing or breaking up a liaison have been hypothesized to be the primary motivational state that accompanies jealousy and that distinguishes jealousy from other emotions such as anger [1], [19]. Although vocalizations during the experiment were relatively infrequent, whining occurred significantly more in the jealousy condition than in the book condition. Barking did not significantly differ across conditions.At the suggestion of a reviewer, we summed the behaviors presented in Figure 1 for each condition in order to get a sense of the effect size of the jealousy condition and performed within-subjects ANOVA with partial eta-squared tests. Partial eta-squared for the dog vs. jack-o-lantern conditions was .41 and for dog vs. book was .58.In the preverbal human infant literature, jealousy is accompanied not only by negative affect but also by heightened interest and attention toward the mother while she is interacting with what appears to be another infant [10][12]. We found similar effects in dogs. Results for within-subject ANOVAs are presented in the text while results for follow up paired t-tests are displayed in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, dogs gazed significantly more at their owners (F(2, 70) = 7.47, p< .001, = .18) and the objects (F(2, 70) = 56.39, p< .001, = .62) in the conditions in which the owner was displaying affection towards an object relative to the control condition of reading aloud. Furthermore, when the object of affection appeared to be a conspecific, dogs looked more at the object relative to when it was a novel item (jack-o-lantern). This pattern is furthered supported by the inversely related measures of disinterest, operationally defined by orienting the body away from the owner and object (Figure 2). Dogs spent significantly more time ignoring the owner and object in the book condition relative to the conditions that involved displays of affection: F(2, 70) = 30.62, p< .001, = .47 for owner; F(2, 70) = 87.27, p< .001, = .71 for object.Behaviors during the post-task period were similar to those seen during the actual interaction (although less informative given that behavior was merely coded as present/absent). More dogs ignored the object in the jack-o-lantern (94.4%) and book (91.7%) conditions than in the dog condition (52.8%); Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.01, p< .001. There was also a significant difference in the number of dogs who observed the object across conditions (72.2% in dog condition; 63.9% in jack-o-lantern condition; and 44.4% in book condition): Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.58, p< .04. There was not a significant difference in the number of dogs who followed their owner after each condition, 2 (2) = 4.67, p = .10.Was the stuffed dog perceived as real? One might wonder whether the subject dogs believed that the stuffed animal was a real dog. The data discussed previously, particularly the aggressive behaviors aimed at the stuffed animal, would seem to suggest that they did. Perhaps even more compellingly, 86% of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the toy dog during the experiment or post-experiment phases. Having a faux rival dog enabled us to maximize the amount of control we had in the experiment. That jealousy behaviors were seen under these somewhat impoverished social conditions leads us to predict that such behaviors would be even more enhanced in the present of an actual rival dog who responded to the owner's affectionate displays. In the present work any single behavior might not be indicative of jealousy per se. However, the pattern of behaviors, particularly when dogs were confronted with their owners displaying affection to what appeared to be another dog, is similar to the constellation of behaviors seen in humans. These data thus present a strong case that domestic dogs have a form of jealousy.Individual Differences An anonymous reviewer suggested that our data might reflect individual differences in dog cognition and/or jealousy. One possibility is that only some dogs perceived the stuffed dog as real and that this difference in cognitive ability resulted in jealousy in some dogs but not others. To the reviewer's mind, only those dogs that aggressed against the rival dog can be shown to definitively consider the fake dog stimulus as real. We believe that the fact that the vast majority of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the stuffed dog (including all of the aggressive dogs) suggests that most of the dogs conceptualized the dog as real, but we cannot rule out the reviewer's suggestion. However, even if most dogs perceived the stimulus as real, it is still possible that only some of them reacted with jealousy to it. The reviewer suggested some additional analyses to explore possible individual differences. One question is whether the snapping dogs were the only ones to show additional jealous behaviors. As described below, our data suggest that they were not, although their jealousy might be argued to be more intense in some respects than their nonsnapping peers. In total, 41.7% of dogs snapped during or after their owner interacted with the stuffed dog. We found that these aggressive dogs did display many other jealous behaviors: All of them pushed at the owner and 86.7% pushed at the fake dog during the jealousy interaction. There was also some tendency for these dogs to spend more time (although not significantly so) attending to the owner and the fake dog (and conversely less time ignoring the owner and rival) than nonsnapping dogs. However, not all jealous behaviors were more common in the snapping dogs. Whining was similar across the two types of dogs and while 26.7% of the snapping dogs attempted to get between their owner and the rival dog, 33.3% of the nonaggressive dogs did so. Moreover, many of the nonsnapping dogs also displayed other jealousy indicators. For example, 61.9% pushed at the owner and 57.1% pushed at the stuffed dog. These percents are higher if the dogs that did not sniff the rear end are excluded (who likely did not perceive the stuffed dog as a threat). Thus, these exploratory analyses would argue against the suggestion that only aggressive dogs displayed jealous behaviors, although their jealousy may be viewed as more extreme. These data raise the possibility that dogs, like humans, show individual differences in how jealousy is exhibited, which ranges from attention seeking and restorative behaviors to aggressive acts. The fact some dogs (13.8%) failed to sniff the rear end of the fake dog raises stimulating questions for future studies. Jealous behaviors were infrequent among these animals, suggesting that they were not in an emotional state (e.g., none pushed on the owner or the stuffed dog and only one got between them). One interesting possible avenue for future work is to examine the cognitive abilities that are associated with not believing the stuffed dog is real. It might be that such dogs are less cognitively sophisticated (they do not perceive the toy as representation of a real dog.).

In sum, it may be that while all dogs have the neurobiological cognitive capacity for jealousy, the current situation may have failed to induce the emotional state in some dogs.

TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/letter-from-an-airline-pilot/,Letter from an Airline Pilot,Uncategorized,02-Dec-02,Letter from airline pilot describes a flight on which the remains of a fallen U.S. soldier were carried.,http://acaptainslog.blogspot.com/2008/10/fallen-soldier-rest-of-story.html,1,FALSE,No Error,"My post, Fallen Soldier, received thousands of views this past weekend. I am writing this post to tell you what happened after that flight and some things I have just come to know.After the family was taken off the aircraft, they were immediately escorted down to the ramp and the cargo door. I found out last week that the team of escorts that met the aircraft to assist the family, are employee volunteers. These employees come from all areas of the airline for the single purpose of giving a fallen soldier the honor, respect, and dignity they deserve during their final journey home. I am proud to tell you that the corporation I work for unconditionally supports the efforts of this group of volunteers.They call themselves the Patriot Guard Riders and have all volunteer teams in Boston, Atlanta, Detroit, Norfolk, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. The Atlanta team has special jumpsuits made by a uniform supplier, displaying a military seal on the back. The team members render honors along with the military escorts and pay last respects to deceased service men and women as they are transported through the airport. Most volunteers are former service men and women or have family who are or were in the military. They have flags and when possible present a commemorative medallion on behalf of my company to the soldiers family with the inscription: We will not forget their sacrifice.I found this quote on the company's employee website, written by the senior vice president of customer service. I have replaced names with the letter X, to remain anonymous in my writing. Were proud of our honor guard volunteers who represent XXXXX in paying special honors to the men and women who have served our country. The ceremony is not only meaningful to the families, but for everyone who has the privilege of seeing it.The article on the website was about the return of U.S Air Force Capt. Lorenza Conner, a pilot killed when he was shot down in Vietnam, in 1967. According to the article, his remains were discovered and identified last year. Apparently Capt Conner is a Georgia native and his remains were returning home for burial. One of our pilots, a Vietnam vet himself, piloted the last leg home from Honolulu. One of the Guard Riders was quoted, I am doing this in part as a XXXXX employee, but I ride escort as a Ride Captain with the Patriot Guard Riders, escorting fallen soldiers home during funeral services. Some of these volunteers use their free time to ride along with the remains to their final destination, all the way to burial.I must throw in a thumbs up for the countless flight attendants who go out of their way to thank every service member in uniform as they exit the aircraft upon arrival. I listen to boarding announcements where along with the normal words, a statement is made to the cabin that there are military members on board today and that their service is appreciated.Back to the family and their journey home with their son, husband and father. The team escorted the family to the cargo hold. After thanking the rest of the passengers, I proceeded to the pilot lounge as I had a couple of hours to go before my next flight. The lounge is a large area with computers, lockers, tables, chairs, etc. There normally is a lot of traffic there. I saw a friend of mine who was in my original training class twenty years ago. I have always liked Dave, he and I have bantered back and forth for years.You see, Dave was a fighter pilot and I flew the heavy cargo planes. Dave was a dashing young fighter pilot in the day, crazy as they come and damn good at what he did. He taught fighter pilots, how to teach fighter pilots. His weapon of choice was the F-16. I flew cargo all over the world; doing some things I will never be able to tell you. My weapon of choice was a small Swiss army knife. It could open a can of beefaroni or a bottle of beer. My mission was to constantly seek the ultimate beaches, rivers, ice fields, and other naturally spectacular places, wherever I went.Although Dave was an Air Force pilot, he managed to learn to swear like a sailor. Dave is now in his fifties and I can attest to the simple fact that he has officially made the transition to being a loud and crusty old fighter pilot. I had not seen him in a while so I walked up and pinched his left nipple as hard as I could. Jesus, you dumb bastard, let me kick you in the nuts!, he said, while not one other pilot bothered to look our way. Hey, I was just making sure you were still alive. That stupid ass grin you keep on that pasty white sheet, you call a face, makes you look like a mannequin, I said. And so it goes for a few minutes. We finally settle down and catch up on life, his in Florida, mine in California. I asked him if he had time to get a bite to eat. He said, Yeah, I dont sign in for a few hours, I work a flight to Norfolk at 4:30.Norfolk! I said. Is it flight XXXX? I said. Dave was flying the soldier home on his last leg. I proceeded to tell Dave what had happened on my flight. At one point, Dave flushed crimson red, and then tears welled up in his eyes. Fuck, I cry like a god damn baby every time I hear stories like that, he said. Well listen up soldier, you have the honor of taking him home and I have a mission for you, I said. We talked a bit longer and I had to leave. Dave knew the family was going to be escorted back down to the cargo hold to watch the soldiers remains be put aboard his aircraft. Dave was planning on getting to the gate early to introduce himself to the family and escort. He wanted to be standing with them outside, if the family wanted that. That crusty ass fighter pilot was on a mission and nothing was going to stop him from doing anything and everything he could for that family. They could not have been in better hands.I have not seen Dave since that day. Somewhere down the road we will catch up with each other and I will ask him how the rest of that day went. In the mean time, the honor, respect, and dignity that our fallen soldiers deserve, will continue 24/7 at my company. I am sure other airlines have good people doing the same type of thing.

Our military members around the world will miss out on hometown celebrations, instead, performing the duties assigned to them. This story is in honor of them.As a commercial pilot, I too see the effects of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month I showed up to start a trip and was approached by a gate agent. Captain, good morning, I wanted to inform you that we have H.R. on this flight, she said. H.R. stands for human remains. Are they military?, I asked. Yes, she said. Is there and escort?, I asked. Yes, I already assigned him a seat, she said. Would you please tell him to come to the flight deck, you can board him early, I said.A short while later, a young army sergeant entered the flight deck. He was the image of the perfectly dressed soldier. He introduced himself and I asked him about his soldier. The escorts of these fallen soldiers talk about them as if they are still alive and with us. My soldier is on his way back to Virginia, he said. He proceeded to answer my questions, but offered no words on his own. I asked him if there was anything I could do for him and he said no. I told him that he has the toughest job in the military and that I appreciated the work that he does for the families of our fallen soldiers. The first officer and I got up out of our seats to shake his hand. He left the flight deck to find his seat.We completed our preflight checks, pushed back and performed an uneventful departure. About 30 minutes into our flight I received a call from the lead flight attendant in the cabin. I just found out the family of the soldier we are carrying, is onboard, he said. He then proceeded to tell me that the father, mother, wife and 2-year-old daughter were escorting their son, husband, and father home. The family was upset because they were unable to see the container that the soldier was in before we left. We were on our way to a major hub at which the family was going to wait 4 hours for the connecting flight home to Virginia. The father of the soldier told the flight attendant that knowing his son was below him in the cargo compartment and being unable to see him was too much for him and the family to bare. He had asked the flight attendant if there was anything that could be done to allow them to see him upon our arrival. The family wanted to be outside by the cargo door to watch the soldier being taken off the airplane. I could hear the desperation in the flight attendants voice when he asked me if there was anything I could do. Im on it, I said. I told him that I would get back to him.Airborne communication with my company normally occurs in the form of email like messages. I decided to bypass this system and contact my flight dispatcher directly on a secondary radio. There is a radio operator in the operations control center who connects you to the telephone of the dispatcher. I was in direct contact with the dispatcher. I explained the situation I had onboard with the family and what it was the family wanted. He said he understood and that he would get back to me.Two hours went by and I had not heard from the dispatcher. We were going to get busy soon and I needed to know what to tell the family. I sent a text message asking for an update. I saved the return message from the dispatcher and this following is the text.Captain, sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. There is policy on this now and I had to check on a few things. Upon your arrival a dedicated escort team will meet the aircraft. The team will escort the family to the ramp and planeside. A van will be used to load the remains with a secondary van for the family. The family will be taken to their departure area and escorted into the terminal where the remains can be seen on the ramp. It is a private area for the family only. When the connecting aircraft arrives, the family will be escorted onto the ramp and planeside to watch the remains being loaded for the final leg home. Captain, most of us here in flight control are veterans. Please pass our condolences on to the family, thanks.I sent a message back telling flight control thanks for a good job. I printed out the message and gave it to the lead flight attendant to pass on to the father. The lead flight attendant was very thankful and told me, You have no idea how much this will mean to them. Things started getting busy for the descent, approach and landing.After landing, we cleared the runway and taxied to the ramp area. The ramp is huge with 15 gates on either side of the alleyway. It is always a busy area with aircraft maneuvering every which way to enter and exit. When we entered the ramp and checked in with the ramp controller, we were told that all traffic was being held for us. There is a team in place to meet the aircraft, we were told. It looked like it was all coming together, then I realized that once we turned the seat belt sign off, everyone would stand up at once and delay the family from getting off the airplane. As we approached our gate, I asked the copilot to tell the ramp controller we were going to stop short of the gate to make an announcement to the passengers. He did that and the ramp controller said, Take your time.I stopped the aircraft and set the parking brake. I pushed the public address button and said, Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking. I have stopped short of our gate to make a special announcement. We have a passenger on board who deserves our honor and respect. His name is private XXXXXX, a soldier who recently lost his life. Private XXXXXX is under your feet in the cargo hold. Escorting him today is army sergeant XXXXXXX. Also onboard are his father, mother, wife, and daughter. Your entire flight crew is asking for all passengers to remain in their seats to allow the family to exit the aircraft first. Thank you.We continued the turn to the gate, came to a stop and started our shutdown procedures. A couple of minutes later I opened the cockpit door. I found the two forward flight attendants crying, something you just do not see. I was told that after we came to a stop, every passenger on the aircraft stayed in their seats, waiting for the family to exit the aircraft. When the family got up and gathered their things, a passenger slowly started to clap their hands. Moments later more passengers joined in and soon the entire aircraft was clapping. Words of God Bless You, Im sorry, Thank you, Be proud, and other kind words were uttered to the family as they made their way down the aisle and out of the airplane. They were escorted down to the ramp to finally be with the loved one lost.I never did see the family. Another soldier died, another family grieved and we did what we could. That is the way it works sometimes. I get a call from the cabin and we work as a team to do what we can. That day everybody from the flight crew, to the operations center, to the 184 passengers onboard, we did what we could. Many of the passengers disembarking thanked me for the announcement I made. They were just words, I could say them over and over again, but nothing I say will bring that soldier back. I respectfully ask that all of you reflect on this day and the sacrifices that millions of men and women have made to ensure our freedom, safety, and the right to live a good life.Be safe,FlyGuy.",Captain's Log: Fallen Soldier,,View My Complete Profile,right,right,n,,155,

mostly true,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bills-introduced-by-republicans/,Bills Introduced by Republicans While We Were Distracted by the Russian Spy Drama,Politics,07-Mar-17,Legislation introduced by Republicans during President Trump's first two months in office included bills to: terminate the Environmental Protection Agency; redistribute federal school funding via voucher programs; terminate the Dept. of Education; repeal a wildlife protection rule; repeal the Affordable Care Act; defund Planned Parenthood; establish a national right-to-work law; strip federal funds from sanctuary cities; criminalize abortion; and place new sanctions on Iran.,http://archive.is/zXeMT,1,TRUE,No Error,"The Republican-led Congress is wasting no time forcing through the most horrendous bills seen in decades while Americas eyes are on Russia.With both houses of Congress solidly under Republican control, theres little in the way to stop House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) from sending bills to President Trumps desk that embody the most dangerous aspects of radical right-wing ideology.However unlikely these bills passage would have seemed in the 114th Congress, the possibility of these nine bills becoming law is much higher now, especially considering the flurry of headlines around Donald Trumps ties to Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusal on the ongoing investigation into the presidents Russian connections, and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyaks multiple meetings with several of Trumps top lieutenants.Here are the nine worst bills to keep an eye on:1. H.R. 861: To terminate the Environmental Protection AgencyThis bill  cosponsored by Republican members of Congress from fossil fuel-producing states  is just one sentence long, and says nothing about what would happen to the multiple environmental regulations the EPA has instituted since 1970, or its multibillion-dollar budget, or its thousands of staffers. H.R. 861 is currently awaiting action in the subcommittee on environment.2. H.R. 610: Tax dollars for private schoolsRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced this bill in January, which would redistribute funding earmarked for public schools in the form of vouchers for parents to send children to private schools. Over the long term, this would eventually bankrupt public schools, and create a stratified education system in which cash-strapped public schools would be unable to meet the educational needs of low-income students. The bill is awaiting action in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.3. H.R. 899: To terminate the Department of EducationIf this bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), becomes law, the U.S. Department of Education would terminate by the end of 2018. The bills brevity leaves many questions unanswered, like what would happen with Department of Education grants for public schools and universities, its budget, or its staff. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has said she would personally be fine if the agency she heads were to be abolished4. H.J.R. 69: To repeal a rule protecting wildlifeRep. Don Young (R-Alaska), whose constituents likely include hunters who kill wildlife for sport rather than for food, introduced this joint resolution voicing displeasure with a Department of Interior rule that prohibits non-subsistence hunting in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate.5. H.R. 370: To repeal the Affordable Care ActWhile President Obama was in office, House Republicans voted at least 60 times to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  despite its futility. However, the Trump administration has made the repeal of Obamacare a top priority, meaning the repeal bill from Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) is likely to pass.6. H.R. 354: To defund Planned ParenthoodDespite the widely publicized debunking of the video alleging the womens health nonprofit was selling human organs, Republicans are still refusing to stop destroying Planned Parenthood. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tennessee) introduced a bill that would prevent any federal grants from going to Planned Parenthood for a full year unless they swore to not perform abortions. As the chart below from Planned Parenthood shows, only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood resources go toward abortions, while the vast majority of funding is used to help low-income women get STD tests, contraceptive care, and breast cancer screenings:7. H.R. 785: National Right-to-Work legislationConservative ideologue Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is aiming to cripple unions at the nationwide level with a bill that would systematically deprive labor unions of the funding they need to operate. Unions often provide one of the crucial pillars of support for Democratic candidates and causes, and conservatives aim to destroy them once and for all by going after their funding. Its important to note that right-to-work is bad for all workers, not just union members  in 2015, the Economic Policy Institute learned that wages in right-to-work states are roughly 3.2 percent lower than in non-right-to-work states.8. H.R. 83: Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities ActMultiple cities and states around the country have openly stated that they wont abide by President Trumps plan to aggressively round up and deport undocumented immigrants. A bill by Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pennsylvania) would strip all federal funding of any city that doesnt obey Trumps immigration policies for up to a year.9. H.R. 147: To criminalize abortionRep. Trent Franks (R-Arizona) wants to aggressively prosecute pregnant women seeking abortions, along with abortion providers, by making abortion a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill is currently awaiting action in the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.To fight back against these bills, call 202-224-3121, ask for your member of Congress, and tell them to vote no..","While we were distracted by Trump, Republicans advanced these 9 terrifying bills",2003-05-17,,right,right,n,,158,

Male lions start developing a mane when they reach puberty. This is mainly due to rising levels of the hormone testosterone. Male lions that are castrated, will lose their mane hair because the testes are the main site of testosterone production. Similar to castrated males, female lions do not normally produce sufficient testosterone to produce any significant mane hair. Emma grows a mane In April 2011, Emma, a 13-year-old lioness at the National Zoo starting growing a mane of similar length to that of a sub-adult male. Initially we suspected that she may have some abnormalities of her reproductive tract, so an abdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital. However, all her reproductive organs appeared to be normal. Blood levels of various sex hormones were evaluated and as suspected, she had elevated levels of testosterone. We decided to remove her ovaries as these where most likely the cause of her elevated testosterone. This was done laparoscopically by Dr Marthinus Hartman at Onderstepoort in September 2011. Skin biopsy samples were sent to Stellenbosch University for chromosome analysis to see if Emma had some sort of sex chromosome abnormality, but the results showed that she had normal female XX chromosomes. The removed ovaries were evaluated by the NZG's own pathologist, Dr Emily Lane. Surprisingly, the ""ovaries"" that were removed, only contained cells normally seen in the testicles of males. This was obviously where the testosterone was being produced. Did Emma's ovaries change into testes? What makes this case remarkable, is that the zoo records show that Emma gave birth to four cubs in 2000. In order to give birth to cubs, she must have had normal ovaries at that time. Genetic tests done on Emma and her cubs, so far also seem to confirm that she is the mother of those lions. Further genetic tests are currently being done on samples from the only other female that was present in the zoo at the time to ensure that no mistake was made in identifying the mother of the cubs. If Emma proves to be the mother, then this case seems to indicate that Emma's ovaries changed into testes. This is something that is virtually unheard of in mammals. Other cases Other cases have been documented in the popular literature of lionesses that have developed mane hair. These reports have come from both zoo and free-ranging animals, but so far the abnormality has not been described in the scientific literature. Currently Dr Adrian Tordiffe and other researchers are investigating individual cases reported in the Kruger National Park and in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. After her ovaries were removed, Emma gradually lost her mane hair and returned to her normal female good looks.

The entrance to the caves was sealed up in attempt to keep the trespassers at bay.There are rumours that the caves have also been visited by pagans and druids wanting to hold ceremonies, and are popular at solstice and Halloween.AdvertisingIt is thought the caves have now been opened again although the Shropshire Star has been unable to contact the owners.The caves have also been explored by Shrewsbury photographer Chris Schurke, who runs a blog called Shrewsbury From Where You Are Not, documenting his pictures of the county from unique perspectives.It is not the only Shropshire location with links to the Templars.Within Ludlow Castle is an early Norman chapel dedicated to St Mary Magdalene.Some people say it may have been associated with the Templars as the interior carvings include two Templar crosses and because of the group's affiliation to St Mary Magdalene. It also has a round nave, again in the image of the Holy Sepulchre Church.Penkridge Hall in Leebotwood was built on the site of the former Lydley Preceptory, a building serving as an administration centre for a group of Templars.It was founded in 1158 and closed in 1308 when the order was dissolved.St Jame's Church in Cardington was acquired by the Templars in 1186 and the first documented priest was Arnulf. After the suppression of the Templars in 1308, Cardington Church was taken over by the Crown and given to the Knights Hospitaller in 1314, an order of knights created in 1113 by the Pope to provide care for sick, poor or injured pilgrims.Stanton Long Grange was founded in 1221 as a farm and closed in 1308 when the order was dissolved.The site is at the hamlet of Brookhampton but nothing now remains.In Herefordshire, Holt Preen Grange was founded in 1232 as a farm and closed in 1308 when the order was dissolved. All surface remains were destroyed when Holt Farm was built on the site. Similar caves dating back about 700 years in Royston, Hertfordshire, were under attack from an infestation of worms eating the chalk walls behind them.The beehive-shaped chamber was cut out of a 180ft-thick seam of chalk and stretches 30ft beneath the centre of the market town, underneath a betting shop.It was uncovered by chance during building work in 1742 and puzzled historians ever since.",See the secret Knights Templar caves beneath a Shropshire field - pictures and video,,,right,context,context,,164,

He stayed two years, moved to the University of Nebraska to finish up his degree, and emerged from college at age 20 with nearly $10,000 from his childhood businesses.Despite the success of Buffett Partnership, its founder dissolved the firm in 1969 to focus on the development of Berkshire Hathaway. He phased out its textile manufacturing division, instead expanding the company by buying assets in media (The Washington Post), insurance (GEICO) and oil (Exxon). Immensely successful, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" even managed to spin seemingly poor investments into gold, most notably with his purchase of scandal-plagued Salomon Brothers in 1987. Following Berkshire Hathaway's significant investment in Coca-Cola, Buffett became director of the company from 1989 until 2006. He has also served as director of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings, Graham Holdings Company and The Gillette Company.In 1956 Buffet formed the firm Buffett Partnership Ltd. in his hometown of Omaha. Utilizing the techniques learned from Graham, he was successful in identifying undervalued companies and became a millionaire. One such enterprise Buffett valued was a textile company named Berkshire Hathaway. He began accumulating stock in the early 1960s, and by 1965 he had assumed control of the company.Between 2006 and 2017, Buffett has given away close to $28 billion in charity, according to a report by USA Today .Buffet was previously married to his first wife Susan Thompson from 1952 until her death in 2004, although the couple separated in the 70s. He and Susan had three children: Susan, Howard and Peter.Born in Nebraska in 1930, Warren Buffett demonstrated keen business abilities at a young age. He formed Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956, and by 1965 he had assumed control of Berkshire Hathaway. Overseeing the growth of a conglomerate with holdings in the media, insurance, energy and food and beverage industries, Buffett became one of the world's richest men and a celebrated philanthropist.Recent Activity and PhilanthropyIn June 2006, Buffett made an announcement that he would be giving his entire fortune away to charity, committing 85 percent of it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This donation became the largest act of charitable giving in United States history. In 2010 Buffett and Gates announced they had formed The Giving Pledge campaign to recruit more wealthy individuals for philanthropic causes.ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

He began undergoing radiation treatment in July, and successfully completed his treatment in November.The health scare did little to slow the octogenarian, who annually ranks near the top of the Forbes world billionaires list. In February 2013, Buffett purchased H. J. Heinz with private equity group 3G Capital for $28 billion. Later additions to the Berkshire Hathaway stable included battery maker Duracell and Kraft Foods Group, which merged with Heinz in 2015 to form the third-largest food and beverage company in North America.ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

""I will meet him in Omaha or Mar-a-Lago or, he can pick the place, anytime between now and election, he said at an August 1 rally in Omaha. ""I'll bring my return, he'll bring his return. We're both under audit. And believe me, nobody's going to stop us from talking about what's on those returns."" Trump did not accept the offer, and his refusal to share his returns ultimately did not prevent his election to the presidency in 2016.In May 2017, Buffett revealed that he had begun selling some of the approximately 81 million shares he owned in IBM stock, noting that he did not value the company as highly as he did six years earlier. Following another sale in the third quarter, his stake in the company dropped to about 37 million shares. On the flip side, he increased his investment in Apple by 3 percent, and became Bank of America's largest shareholder by exercising warrants for 700 million shares. Early the following year, he added more Apple shares to make it Berkshire Hathaway's largest common stock investment.Healthcare VentureOn January 30, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase and Amazon delivered a joint press release in which they announced plans to team up and form a new healthcare company for their U.S. employees.According to the release, the yet-to-be-named company will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints"" as it tries to find ways to cut costs and improve the overall process for patients, with an initial focus on technology solutions.Calling the swelling costs of healthcare a ""hungry tapeworm on the American economy,"" Buffett said, ""We share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the countrys best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.""In March, outlets reported that Berkshire Hathaway's HomeServices of America Inc., the second-largest residential brokerage owner in the U.S., was set to take more steps toward the top spot, held by Realogy's NRT LLC. Buffett said he ""barely noticed"" when Berkshire Hathaway originally acquired HomeServices, then part of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., back in 2000.Early LifeWarren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett's father, Howard, worked as a stockbroker and served as a U.S. congressman. His mother, Leila Stahl Buffett, was a homemaker. Buffett was the second of three children and the only boy.Buffett demonstrated a knack for financial and business matters early in his childhood. Friends and acquaintances have said the young boy was a mathematical prodigy who could add large columns of numbers in his head, a talent he occasionally demonstrated in his later years.Warren often visited his father's stockbrokerage shop as a child, and chalked in the stock prices on the blackboard in the office. At 11 years old he made his first investment, buying three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 per share. The stock quickly dropped to only $27, but Buffett held on tenaciously until they reached $40. He sold his shares at a small profit, but regretted the decision when Cities Service shot up to nearly $200 a share. He later cited this experience as an early lesson in patience in investing.First Entrepreneurial VentureBy the age of 13, Buffett was running his own businesses as a paperboy and selling his own horseracing tip sheet. That same year, he filed his first tax return, claiming his bike as a $35 tax deduction.In 1942 Buffett's father was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and his family moved to Fredricksburg, Virginia, to be closer to the congressman's new post. Buffett attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C., where he continued plotting new ways to make money. During his high school tenure, he and a friend purchased a used pinball machine for $25. They installed it in a barbershop, and within a few months the profits enabled them to buy other machines. Buffett owned machines in three different locations before he sold the business for $1,200.",Warren Buffett Biography,,Warren Buffett,context,context,n,,165,

And shes not the only one.Five lionesses in Botswana have grown a mane and are showing male-like behaviours. One is even roaring and mounting other females.AdvertisementMale lions are distinguished by their mane, which they use to attract females, and they roar to protect their territory or call upon members of their pride. Females lack a mane and are not as vocal.But sometimes lionesses grow a mane and even behave a bit like males. However, until now, reports of such maned lionesses have been extremely rare and largely anecdotal. We knew they existed, but little about how they behave.Now, Geoffrey D. Gilfillan at the University of Sussex in Falmer, UK, and colleagues have reported five lionesses sporting a mane at the Moremi Game Reserve in Botswanas Okavango delta.Gilfillan started studying these lionesses back in March 2014, and for the next two years he focused on recording the behaviour of one of them, called SaF05. She had an underdeveloped mane and was larger than most females.While SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour  staying with the pride, mating males  she also has some male behaviours, such as increased scent-marking and roaring, as well as mounting other females, says Gilfillan.Although females do roar and scent-mark like males, they usually do so less frequently, he says. SaF05, however, was much more male-like in her behaviour, regularly scent-marking and roaring.Jessica VitaleA likely explanation is an increased level of testosterone as these lionesses mature, says Luke Hunter, president and chief conservation officer at the global wild cat conservation organisation Panthera.In lions, testosterone directly affects the development of manes. Castrated males, for example, lose their ability to produce testosterone and promptly lose their mane, too.In 2011, a captive lioness called Emma at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa developed a mane. Tests revealed high levels of testosterone due to a problem in her ovaries, and once they were removed she reverted to a typical lioness.The idea that testosterone is implicated in the Botswana lionesses is also backed by observations of their reproductive success, says Kathleen Alexander at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.While some of the maned lionesses were observed mating, none of them became pregnant, suggesting they are infertile, a known consequence of high levels of androgens such as testosterone in females, she says. The behavioural changes suggest this is likely the case.Hunter suspects this explanation applies to the animals studied by Gilfillan and his colleagues. Given all five known maned females come from the Okavango region, there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon, he says.I dont think this is anything to be concerned about, says Hunter. Although the females are apparently infertile, they otherwise appear to live long, healthy lives. And from a conservation perspective, there is nothing to suggest the pattern is increasing or will ever be anything more than a rare, local phenomenon.No one seems to be studying the exact genetic and hormonal causes of this phenomenon at the moment. I guess there are just one or a few genes altered, says Vincent Savolainen at Imperial College London, who had a student briefly work on the possible causes. I believe some masculinised genes have been documented in domesticated cats  it would be good to look into this, especially given that the cat genome is available as reference.Could the masculinised females in fact be a boon to the pride when it comes to competing with other prides? Its possible, it seems.Gilfillan says he once saw SaF05 bring down a zebra. A neighbouring pride stole the zebra from SaF05, but in return SaF05 killed two of their cubs.Cub-killing behaviour is rare in females but common in males.Journal reference: African Journal of Ecology, DOI: 10.1111/aje.12360",Five wild lionesses grow a mane and start acting like males,,Karl Gruber,right,context,right,,167,

What is naled?Naled is an insecticide that has been registered since 1959 for use in the United States. It is used primarily for controlling adult mosquitoes but is also used on food and feed crops and in greenhouses. For mosquito control, naled is most commonly applied aerially as an ultra-low volume (ULV) spray. ULV sprayers mounted on planes or helicopters dispense very fine aerosol droplets containing small quantities of insecticide mixed with water that drift through the air and kill mosquitoes on contact. The amount of spray that reaches the ground is small, and the concentration applied is very small (only about 1-2 tablespoons of naled is applied per acre treated).2. Is EPA currently evaluating the safety of naled? What is the status of registration review for naled?EPA is currently re-evaluating naled as part of its routine registration review process. EPA expects to issue new human health and ecological risk assessments for naled before the end of 2017.This review of naled is a standard re-evaluation required by law every 15 years by law for every registered pesticide. The periodic review of pesticide registrations, or registration review, is required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act. EPA periodically reviews existing registered pesticides to ensure they can be used safely, without unreasonable risks to human health and the environment. The registration review program is intended to make sure that, as the ability to assess risk evolves and as policies and practices change, all registered pesticides continue to meet the statutory standard of no unreasonable adverse effects.Learn more about EPAs registration review process.3. Does naleds use for mosquito control pose health risks to people?When applied according to label instructions, EPA does not expect the use of naled for public health mosquito control to raise a human health concern. People are unlikely to breathe in amounts large enough or touch anything with enough insecticide on it to harm them. However, anyone who is concerned because of an existing health problem should talk to their doctor. Also, people who tend to be sensitive to chemicals in general, including household chemicals, could experience short-term effects, such as skin, eye, and nose irritation. Contact your local mosquito control program to get specific information on spraying in your area.4. Has EPA estimated the risks of naled to children specifically?EPA estimates exposure and risks to both children and adults routinely, including those associated with naled. Because of the small amount of naled released (about 1-2 tablespoons of naled is applied per acre treated), exposures are below an amount that might be expected to pose a health concern to children or adults.5. Where is naled being used for mosquito control?Naled is one of the most widely used pesticides in the United States for aerial mosquito control. In recent years, naled has been applied by aerial spraying to about 16 million acres per year within the mainland United States as part of routine mosquito control. Naled has been used in highly populated major metropolitan areas as well as agricultural and more rural areas.Top of Page6. Does naled work on mosquitos carrying Zika?Naled has been successfully used for many years in the mainland United States and has been effective in the ongoing effort to control mosquitoes carrying Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and other possible diseases in areas where these viruses have been identified. Laboratory tests conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in February and March 2016 on 14 separate populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from across Puerto Rico showed that they were highly susceptible to naled. These results, combined with the success of naleds aerial use in Florida in 2016, indicate that aerial application of naled can be effective for Zika emergency situations as part of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM) effort.

Are insects becoming resistant to naled?Resistance in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is not a concern at this time for naled. Many acres across the United States have been sprayed with naled each year, and resistance has not been detected in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.8. Are there special precautions to be taken during naled spraying?People may prefer to stay inside and close windows and doors when spraying takes place, but it is not necessary. Those who are especially concerned about chemicals may choose to take some of these steps to help reduce exposure.Contact your local health department or mosquito control program to get specific information on spraying in your area.Stay indoors with the windows closed during spraying.If you are outdoors when spraying takes place and come in contact with the chemical, rinse your skin and eyes with water.Wash fruits and vegetables from your garden before storing, cooking, or eating.Cover outside items like furniture and grills before the spraying takes place. Bring pets and items like pet food dishes and childrens toys indoors. Rinse any uncovered items left outside before using.If you think you have had a reaction to the spraying of naled, talk to your doctor or call the regional Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.9. How will I know if aerial spraying is going to take place?Decisions about where and when to spray are made by local mosquito control or public health officials. Listen for announcements in your community or look for posts on social media with the dates, times, and locations of upcoming sprayings. They are usually announced a day or two before they are scheduled to occur, and some districts post this information to their website.Top of Page10. Does naleds use for mosquito control pose risks to water supplies or to people eating fruits or vegetables grown in home gardens?Aerial ULV sprays dispense very fine aerosol droplets containing small quantities of active ingredient that stay aloft and kill mosquitoes. The amount of pesticide that reaches the ground is small and dissipates very quickly. In addition, naled is approved by EPA for application directly to food crops at higher rates than those used for mosquito control. Drinking water is also considered in the EPA evaluation of all uses as a potential source of exposure.11. Is naled harmful to wildlife?Risks to wildlife are minimal because naled is applied at low rates and does not persist in the environment. Because naled is an insecticide, invertebrates such as insects, water fleas, and spiders could be affected. Small wildlife present in the immediate treatment area could be exposed shortly after spraying occurs but long-term effects are not expected.12. How can beekeepers reduce the risk of bee exposure to naled?Spraying naled can kill bees that are outside of their hives at the time of spraying; therefore, spraying is recommended at dawn or dusk when bees are usually inside their hives. Although we do not anticipate that bees will have significant exposure to naled, beekeepers can reduce exposure even more by covering colonies when spraying takes place, or if possible, relocating colonies to an untreated site. Providing clean sources of food (supplemental sugar water and protein diets) and clean drinking water to honey bee colonies during application can further reduce exposure.13. What other measures should be taken to control mosquitoes besides aerial spraying? What can I do to control mosquitoes or prevent mosquito bites?Help eliminate any standing water (even small amounts) to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs. If water cannot be eliminated, such as in ornamental water features, use larvicides (available at many retailers) or other control measures to minimize opportunities for breeding. For example, you might be able to add fish that eat larvae to a pond, or add a fountain or aerator to keep the water moving.Use window and door screens to keep mosquitoes from entering your home, workplace, or childrens schools.Use EPA-registered insect repellents to prevent getting bitten. Products that are EPA-registered have been confirmed to be safe and effective when you follow the directions.Dress in light-colored clothing, long pants, and long sleeves.For information on the regulatory status of naled, including the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (PDF)(152 pp, 983 K, About PDF), see the Chemical Search page for naled.Top of Page",Naled for Mosquito Control,2007-05-16,Us Epa Ocspp Opp Fead,context,irrelevant,context,,171,

I cant change that. I have no flexibility.He said 42 people under Trump require protection, including 18 members of his family. Only 31 people required security teams during the Obama administration.In the first seven months of the Trump administration, agents assigned to the president traveled with him nearly every weekend to one of his properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia.They also accompanied Trumps family members who have taken business trips and vacations in the US and abroad, Alles said.The compensation has become such a critical concern that Alles said he has begun discussions with lawmakers about raising the salary and overtime cap for agents to $187,000 from $160,000  at least for Trumps first term.Even with that bump, Alles said about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours theyve already logged, the newspaper reported.Since the January inauguration, Trump has traveled to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, seven times, to his golf resort in Bedminster, NJ, five times and to Trump Tower once, the report said.The General Accounting Office said manpower and equipment costs to protect the president during his jaunts to Mar-a-Lago cost about $3 million each trip, the newspaper said.The Secret Service has spent nearly $60,000 on golf cart rentals this year as its protects Trump on his golf courses in Florida and New Jersey.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has talked with Alles about the pay problem and has pledged to find a permanent solution, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Werner, told USA Today.We cannot expect the Secret Service to be able to recruit and keep the best of the best if they are not being paid for these increases (in overtime hours), Werner told the news outlet.Rep.

People could identify as one of 15 possibilities, including now-derogatory words such as Negro. These classifications might shed some light on why some federal laws from that time contain outdated verbiage thats now being addressed.After it was unanimously passed with 380 votes, President Barack Obama signed H.R. 4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the 70s that define minorities with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.The Department of Energy Act has for decades described minorities as, a Negro, Puerto Rican, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent.The new bill changes the language to, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, a Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or an Alaska Native. Theres also similar language in the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act.The bill was sponsored by Rep. Grace Meng, D-NY, with 74 Democratic co-sponsors and two Republican ones, who focused on the word Oriental.[Oriental] is an insulting term that needed to be removed from the books, and I am extremely pleased that my legislation to do that is now the law of the land, Meng said in a statement.The U.S. Census never used the word Oriental, which became associated in the U.S. with exoticism and Asian-American stereotypes in the 20th century. But it dropped Negro from identities in 2013, after people during the 2010 count said they were offended by it.The director at the time said 56,000 people during research in the 1990s written under other race that they identified as Negro. So the census had continued to include the word in its 2000 count, and also in 2010, but by then people were raising concerns.I apologize to them. I am confident that the intent of my colleagues in using the same wording as Census 2000 was to make sure as many people as possible saw words that matched their self-identities. Full inclusiveness was the goal, Robert Groves, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, wrote.

Two bills were signed into law on Thursday of last week to help California be better prepared for future droughts and the effects of climate change.The mandatory water conservation standards will be permanent, according to their wording, and not just for use in times of crisis. To make a long story short, now that these bills are law, its illegal to take a shower and do a load of laundry in the same day because youll exceed your ration.Heres the wording of the new laws.Senate Bill 606 establishes a governing body to oversee all water suppliers, both private and public and will require extensive paperwork from those utility companies.Assembly Bill 1668 is where it gets personal. This establishes limits on indoor water usage for every person in California and the amount allowed will decrease even further over the next 12 years.The bill, until January 1, 2025, would establish 55 gallons per capita daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, beginning January 1, 2025, would establish the greater of 52.5 gallons per capita daily or a standard recommended by the department and the board as the standard for indoor residential water use, and beginning January 1, 2030, would establish the greater of 50 gallons per capita daily or a standard recommended by the department and the board as the standard for indoor residential water use. The bill would impose civil liability for a violation of an order or regulation issued pursuant to these provisions, as specified.If youre wondering how the government would know how much water your family is using, the utility providers will be obligated to rat you out of face massive fines. And theyre encouraged to spy in all sorts of creative ways. They shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.Some analysisNow, if youre wondering where I get my assertion that you cant shower and do laundry on the same day, heres some math:An 8-minute shower uses about 17 gallons of waterA load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of waterA bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of waterA dishwasher uses 6 gallons of waterThere are also standards to be established for outdoor use such as landscaping, caring for livestock, and gardening, but those numbers dont seem to be available at this time. Maybe Californians just get to wait in suspense to see if their chickens are allowed to have water on the same day as their vegetables. Back when I lived in California, we were only allowed to water our gardens two times per week, which, in that heat, as you can imagine, didnt lead to very productive gardens.Farmers on a larger scale will have to jump through numerous hoops and create water management plans which must then be approved by the people in suits because obviously, theyll know more about the needs of crops and livestock than the farmers willOh, and dont worry, rich people. There will be provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features. So you can still have your pretty fountains and pools while the rest of the peons take 2 showers a week. One might wonder if variances will apply to the wealthy for their landscaping needs.The State Water Resources Control Board, which will oversee local agencies progress, will also consider possible variances for some districts that need additional allowances due to specific local circumstances. ( sourceWhat if you dont comply?If you dont plan to comply its going to be way cheaper to move. Here are the fines Californians will be looking at  and its not a typo  these fines are PER DAY.(1) If the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years or during a period for which the Governor has issued a proclamation of a state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8550) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) based on drought conditions, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each day in which the violation occurs. (2) For all violations other than those described in paragraph (1), one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day in which the violation occurs.Its important to note that your usage is only tracked if you have municipal water. If you have a well, at this point, you will probably be okay. Back when I lived there, the idea of metering private wells and billing the owners for use had been floated around, but most people resisted and it wasnt enforced. If you truck your water in, you can also use as much as you need to.For years it was illegal to use greywater systems in California, despite the epic droughts. Those regulations have been loosened, however, compliance is still extremely onerous. ( Get the details here .) And rainwater catchment is not only legal, its encouraged. In fact, theres a ballot on the table that is a measure to allow rainwater capture systems to be installed without counting as new construction for the purposes of reassessing property taxes.Dont think this only affects CaliforniaNot only are Californians fleeing the state in droves, but there are other ways these restrictive laws can affect the rest of us directly.These stringent measures set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country.There could be a shortage of food coming out of California because there isnt enough water to produce it.The food we do get from there will cost a lot more.Its important to pay attention to stuff like this and not shrug it off because I dont live in California.

mostly true,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fbi-warned-about-white-supremacists/,FBI Warned About White Supremacists Infiltrating Police Departments,Crime  Politics,27-Sep-16,The FBI warned about the possibility white supremacist groups infiltrating U.S.   law enforcement agencies.,http://thegrio.com/2015/05/12/fbi-white-supremacists-law-enforcement/,3,FALSE,No Error,"Because of intensifying civil strife over the recent killings of unarmed black men and boys, many Americans are wondering, Whats wrong with our police? Remarkably, one of the most compelling but unexplored explanations may rest with a FBI warning of October 2006, which reported that White supremacist infiltration of law enforcement represented a significant national threat.Several key events preceded the report. A federal court found that members of a Los Angeles sheriffs department formed a Neo Nazi gang and habitually terrorized the black community. Later, the Chicago police department fired Jon Burge, a detective with reputed ties to the Ku Klux Klan, after discovering he tortured over 100 black male suspects. Thereafter, the Mayor of Cleveland discovered that many of the city police locker rooms were infested with White Power graffiti. Years later, a Texas sheriff department discovered that two of its deputies were recruiters for the Klan.In near prophetic fashion, after the FBIs warning, white supremacy extremism in the U.S. increased, exponentially. From 2008 to 2014, the number of white supremacist groups, reportedly, grew from 149 to nearly a thousand, with no apparent abatement in their infiltration of law enforcement.This year, alone, at least seven San Francisco law enforcement officers were suspended after an investigation revealed they exchanged numerous White Power communications laden with remarks about lynching African-Americans and burning crosses. Three reputed Klan members that served as correction officers were arrested for conspiring to murder a black inmate. At least four Fort Lauderdale police officers were fired after an investigation found that the officers fantasized about killing black suspects.The United States doesnt publicly track white supremacists, so the full range of their objectives remains murky. Although black and Jewish-Americans are believed to be the foremost targets of white supremacists, recent attacks in Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas and North Carolina, demonstrate that other non-whites, and religious and social minorities, are also vulnerable. Perhaps more alarmingly, in the last several years alone, white supremacists have reportedly murdered law enforcement officers in Arkansas, Nevada and Wisconsin.In fact, the FBI reports that of the 511 law enforcement officers killed during felony incidents from 2004 to 2013, white citizens killed the majority of them. Of the citizens stopped by law enforcement officers in New York City and Chicago, white citizens were more likely to be found with guns and drugs. Given the white supremacist penchant for violence, guns and drug trafficking, the findings may be an indication that their network is just as destructive and far-reaching as that of foreign terrorist groups.The unfortunate consequence of todays threat is that a law enforcement officer may be good or bad, a villain or hero; one exceptionally prone to exhibit malicious forms of racial hatred, or distinctively suited to protect the racially oppressed. But the paradox doesnt end there.The white supremacist threat brings to light a dark feature of the American experience that some believed extinct. It rouses ingrained notions of distrusts between police and communities of color while bringing to bear the vital interest citizens of good will share in the complete abolishment of race as a judgmental factor.As the nation struggles to resolve the perplexities of police brutality, the white supremacist threat should inform all Americans that todays civil discord is not borne out of a robust animosity towards law enforcement, most of whom are professional. Rather, its more representative of a centuries-old ideological clash, which has ignited in citizens of good will a desire to affirm notions of racial equality so that the moral ethos of American culture is a reality for all.Samuel V.

Who declared medicinal marijuana safe and it does not have any health risks. Instead it is beneficial for diseases like epilepsy, cancer, Parkinsons, Alzheimers and many other diseases. Now isnt that the sweetest news?? Medicinal Marijuana now being advocated by the World health organization The organization has found also that medicinal marijuana is not addictive and that CBD or cannabidiol which is one of the main relaxant properties in Cannabis should not be even considered a scheduled drug. Image Source: wwwe.stackpathdns.com WHO says Medicinal Marijuana not a scheduled drug and can treat epilepsy Medicinal Cannabis is currently legal in 29 states. Although health experts warn research is too juvenile to rule out side effects, WHO have established the contrary. After several months of their own investigative research, the world health body has declared that CBD can help treat epilepsy without the risk of addiction. The Organization will also run a complete review of cannabis and its related substances in 2018. Physicians and the medicinal marijuana industry have been eagerly awaiting something like this which will speed up the legalization of Marijuana in the entire country. Image Source: www.india.com Path-breaking conclusion after years of research If by chance, the World Health Organization declared cannabis to be a scheduled drug that would become a huge obstacle for physicians from prescribing it as a treatment worldwide. WHOs report published on the 15th Dec 2017, also recommends rigid restrictions on fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid responsible for the deaths of thousands addicted to it. Image Source: www.pinimg.com The report also speaks of the current interest of the member states in the issue of using cannabis as medication. The report also says that WHO has spent years in collecting information and scientific evidence to support the benefits of medicinal marijuana, cannabis and its components. The report also concluded by saying that research on both animal and human subjects have proved that cannabis can be used for its therapeutic value in seizures because of epilepsy and related disorders. Image Source: www.tqn.com The man who proved it possible starting in Mexico The WHO report has made an important decision of not scheduling medicinal marijuana because there is no justification and reason to do so. It will not lead to addiction and hence is considered safe. Previously it was assumed that medicinal marijuana can cause addiction because of the substance THC which has psychoactive properties and induces a high.Image Source: www.straitstimes.com.sgOne of the biggest advocates of legalizing medicinal marijuana is Mexican Raul Elizade who fought to be allowed to treat his daughter suffering from epilepsy. When Raul heard the decision of the WHO, he was overwhelmed. The man was instrumental in influencing the Mexican government to legalize medicinal marijuana. This allowed him to treat his daughter Grace who suffered almost a hundred seizures a day. Today she suffers only a few after the treatment.Elizade, the founder and president of HempMeds Mexico said in an interview Im ecstatic that these international health leaders agree that CBD is a substance that should not be scheduled and has therapeutic value for a variety of medical conditions. Image Source: www.ksat.comWHO declares its official stance on medicinal marijuana, Says it is safe!The World Health Organization had on Dec 14th declared official its stance on medicinal Marijuana being safe for the treatment of several types of disease. This is a definite shot in the arm for those still advocating the legalization of the medicinal use of the drug in various states of the USA where it still remains illegal.Presently the US Department of Justices Drug Enforcement Administration regards marijuana as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, or has no currently accepted medical use in the US, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.Image Source: www.who.intThis is absolutely in contrary to what WHO has declared which may have many desperately in need of the drug for treatment more hopeful for its easy procurement and use.

Likewise, the Organization now advocates the use of medicinal Marijuana in Alzheimers, Crohns disease, certain cancers, Parkinsons and Epilepsy.WHO says that Medicinal Marijuana is perfectly safe for use.

Women are independent and can take care of themselves.This comes as the latest in a series of moves in Saudi Arabia to include women more in the workforce as the kingdom moves to diversify its economy and cut reliance on oil.The trend started in 2011 when the late King Abdullah allowed women onto the government advisory Shura Council. Women can now vote in municipal elections, work in some retail and hospitality jobs and were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in 2012.However Saudi Arabia was still ranked 141 of 144 countries in the 2016 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, healthand education.The system of make guardianship, which requires women to obtain permission from a guardian  father, husband, or son  to travel, study or marry is an impediment to realising womens rights, say rights groups.Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women, said Akeel. Some (men) take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it.Social StreamsCommentscomments",Saudi move to relax male guardianship welcomed by womens advocates,2005-07-17,,right,right,n,,183,

What should we do? Wilkinson told The Washington Post. I said Id be down to see if its true.It seemed unlikely to her that President Trumps press secretary should be dining at a 26-seat restaurant in rural Virginia. But then, it was unlikely that her entire staff would have misidentified Sanders, who had arrived last to a table of eight booked under her husbands name.[Be careful what you wish for Max!: Trump takes aim at Waters after she calls for public harassment of his Cabinet]As she made the short drive to the Red Hen, Wilkinson knew only this:She knew Lexington, population 7,000, had voted overwhelmingly against Trump in a county that voted overwhelmingly for him. She knew the community was deeply divided over such issues as Confederate flags. She knew, she said, that her restaurant and its half-dozen servers and cooks had managed to stay in business for 10 years by keeping politics off the menu.And she knew  she believed  that Sarah Huckabee Sanders worked in the service of an inhumane and unethical administration. That she publicly defended the presidents cruelest policies, and that that could not stand.Im not a huge fan of confrontation, Wilkinson said. I have a business, and I want the business to thrive. This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.Sarah Huckabee Sanders arrives at a media briefing at the White House. (Getty Images)When she walked into the restaurant, Wilkinson saw that there had been no mistake. The Red Hen is no bigger than some apartments, and the group table was impossible to miss: Sanders in a black dress, her husband, three or four men and women of roughly similar ages, and an older couple.They had cheese boards in front of them, Wilkinson said. Like any other family. The kitchen was already preparing the partys main course. Wilkinson interrupted to huddle with her workers.Several Red Hen employees are gay, she said. They knew Sanders had defended Trumps desire to bar transgender people from the military. This month, they had all watched her evade questions and defend a Trump policy that caused migrant children to be separated from their parents.Tell me what you want me to do. I can ask her to leave, Wilkinson told her staff, she said. They said yes. It was important to Wilkinson, she said, that Sanders had already been served  that her staff had not simply refused her on sight. And it was important to her that Sanders was a public official, not just a customer with whom she disagreed, many of whom were included in her regular clientele.All the same, she was tense as she walked up to the press secretarys chair.I said, Im the owner,  she recalled,  Id like you to come out to the patio with me for a word. They stepped outside, into another small enclosure, but at least out of the crowded restaurant.I was babbling a little, but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion, Wilkinson said. I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation.I said, Id like to ask you to leave. Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left.

Ill go. [With Moscow Muellers and other promos, D.C. businesses bank on Trump themes]Sanders went back to the table, picked up her things and walked out. The others at her table had been welcome to stay, Wilkinson said. But they didnt, so the servers cleared away the cheese plates and glasses.They offered to pay, Wilkinson said. I said, No. Its on the house. At the end of the shift, Wilkinson said, staff members left the usual overnight note in the kitchen for the morning manager: a problem with the credit-card machine. Restock vodka and tequila.If youve ever heard the term to 86 someone, it comes from the restaurant industry  code to refuse service, or alternatively to take an item off the menu.86  Sara Huckabee Sanders, read the note, below the reminder to buy more Pellegrino._EMAIL_ got kicked out of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Va tonight.

He had posted it to his public Facebook wall by the time Wilkinson woke up Saturday.For all the angst that evening, Wilkinson said, everything had taken place with decorum. She had been polite; Sanders had been polite; the press secretarys family had been polite as they followed her out the door.Not so much the rest of the world, as it discovered Red Hen waiter Jaike Foley-Schultzs Facebook post: I just served Sarah huckabee sanders for a total of 2 minutes before my owner asked her to leave.A fountain of alternately celebratory and outraged comments gushed from Foley-Schultzs Facebook wall into the Red Hens social media accounts, then its Yelp review page.[The chaotic effort to reunite immigrant parents with their separated kids]Five stars: Thank you for refusing to serve a person who lies to the American people for a living.One star: They made some snide remark about a spit souffle for the Florida nazi.Between the fury and fawning of thousands who almost certainly had not eaten at the restaurant, the Red Hens Yelp reviews almost instantly averaged out to two-and-a-half stars. Another Red Hen in the District was at pains to make clear that it had no affiliation with Wilkinsons place.And that was before Sanders confirmed the story in a Saturday-morning tweet, including the restaurants name and location.I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so, the press secretary wrote. Her actions say far more about her than about me.On Monday, her boss weighed in:The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Wilkinson had no regrets about her decision.I would have done the same thing again, she said Saturday. We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions. This appeared to be one.As she headed out the door to a weekend Main Street festival she had helped organize, she sounded hopeful that the Red Hen could open for business as usual Saturday night. Yes, she had seen calls for #MAGA protests on Facebook. But this is a small enough town, and were known, she said optimistically. This is not going to be a giant surprise to anyone.The day brought surprises of its own.By Saturday afternoon, reporters and photographers loitered outside the restaurant, as did people who had wandered over to gawk.Boo, Red Hen! and Yay, Trump! were shouted, alternately, from the windows of passing cars. A Lexington resident had brought by a bouquet of flowers and a hand-lettered sign that read, Democracy requires principled govt. Thank you Red Hen!!Meanwhile, Stephen Russek of Natural Bridge, Va., told a reporter: Im not crazy about everything Donald Trump does, but what they did to that woman in this restaurant is disgraceful.Chris Roessler, would-be customer, stood outside in confusion. He and his wife had booked an evening reservation, and just received an email canceling it.We would like to avoid exposing our patrons to any potential unpleasantness from outside entities, Red Hen management had written  around the same time that fans of President Trump were doing their best to troll the restaurants phone line with fake reservations.Unaware of the Sanders incident, Roessler said, he had walked to the restaurant to ask for answers, but no one would open the door.[The latest sign of political divide: Shaming and shunning public officials]Over the next two days, a backlash against the Red Hen grew in intensity, eventually reaching the White House.On Monday, Sanders opened her statement in the White House briefing room by speaking about the incident and the numerous aftershocks that came in its wake, including harassment directed toward the restaurant and others with the same name, and remarks made by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters who urged people to confront Trump administration officials in public.We are allowed to disagree but we should be able to do so freely and without fear of harm, Sanders said. Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important. But the calls for harassment and the push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.Sanders, who was criticized over the weekend by some former federal officials who said they believed the use of her official Twitter account to chastise the restaurant violated federal ethics rules, said she had tweeted about it after being contacted by more than a dozen reporters.It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would for any other news of the day story, she said.The public debate has also continued about the appropriateness of the restaurants actions. The Washington Posts editorial board wrote that while Trumps behavior in office might be terrible, officials who work for him should be allowed to eat dinner in peace.Those who are insisting that we are in a special moment justifying incivility should think for a moment how many Americans might find their own special moment, the board wrote.Far-right personalities passed around Wilkinsons home address and phone number on social media.Go after her children [] and husband [] just like the leftist do to Trump employees, a commenter wrote beneath a law professors article criticizing the restaurateur.Sanderss father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, described the episode as bigotry, while Ben Cline, a Republican Virginia lawmaker, called Wilkinson a liberal New York transplant. (She is originally from New York, but has owned a house in Lexington since at least 1996.)And a conspiracy theorist (who also believes Bill Clinton rose to power with the help of Haitian black magic priests) speculated in a viral Twitter thread that Wilkinson could be responsible for every unsolved child abduction in Virginia.An unaffiliated Red Hen restaurant hundreds of miles away was egged overnight, according to Fox 5 DC. Sanderss supporters have reportedly even raged against the Olde Ren Hen in Ontario, Canada, in a misdirected attempt to punish the Lexington restaurant  whose phone lines have been down since the weekend.[Did the Red Hen violate Sarah Huckabee Sanderss rights when it kicked her out?]And if the furor showed any sign of dying down after three days, President Trump reignited it on Monday when he tweeted, based on photographs of the buildings exterior, that the Red Hen was likely unsanitary.They will be conveniently and coincidently audited a few times by the IRS and I wouldnt be surprised if they meet some stiff fines or jail time for tax fraud, a commenter on the far-right /pol/ message board wrote after seeing Trumps tweet.Not to mention if the county health inspector is a conservative, added another.By Monday afternoon, Wilkinsons personal voice mail was full, her business line was not accepting calls, and someone had redirected the Red Hens website to what appeared to be a Japanese-language automotive blog.Murray reported from Lexington, Va.; Eli Rosenberg also contributed to this report, which has been updated several times with new information since it first published on Saturday.Read more:This is what happens when your restaurant is also called Red HenAn 8-year-old tried selling water for a trip to Disneyland.

Every 66 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimers. It ranks as the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S. Its a progressive disease, worsening over a number of years. As Alzheimers advances, it leads to worsening symptoms. They include disorientation, mood and behavior changes, deepening confusion, unfounded suspicions, serious memory loss and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking.Alzheimers can be devastating to those diagnosed, their family members and their friends. There is no known cure for the disease. However, early intervention is often key to a longer lifespan and a better quality of living. Alzheimers can be extremely difficult to diagnose in early stages. Having trouble remembering things does not mean a person has Alzheimers. Thanks to the University of Floridas McKnight Brain Institute Center for Smell and Taste, earlier diagnoses of Alzheimers may be possible.Using just a scoop of peanut butter and a ruler, clinicians have discovered a way to change lives and provide an early diagnosis for Alzheimers. They found a way to give millions of people a chance to make more memories. This method of early diagnosis can help predict and address the disease before it becomes completely overwhelming for those diagnosed.Heres how it works.The study involved participants with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia. Participants were asked to close their eyes and attempt to detect an odor with one nostril at a time. Researchers used a small container of peanut butter to measure the distance from each nostril that the participants were able to detect the odor. The study found that people with Alzheimers disease have a harder time detecting odors from their left nostril when compared to their right nostril.Jennifer Stamps, a University of Florida researcher explained, All of the Alzheimers patients had a left nostril impairment and their right nostril was normal at odor detection which is about 20 centimeters for an older person. Their right nostril was right at 20 centimeters on average but their left nostril was about 10 centimeters on average where they were able to detect it, so there was a big asymmetry there.So why peanut butter? Because it has a strong, familiar smell. People with Alzheimers can lose their ability to smell even before memory problems arise. Using this method to detect Alzheimers early can help doctors slow down the effects of the disease. The peanut butter test is a faster and cheaper was for doctors to confirm an Alzheimers diagnosis.Check out the video below for more information on using the peanut butter test as a form of early detection for Alzheimers.Sources:WimpAlzheimers AssociationUniversity of FloridaAlzheimers Association",Heres How You Can Use Peanut Butter To Diagnose Alzheimers Disease!,2012-06-16,,right,right,n,,187,

These fibers are found in soil and rocks in many parts of the world. They are made mainly of silicon and oxygen, but they also contain other elements. There are 2 main types of asbestos:Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos, is the most common type of asbestos in industrial applications. When looked at under the microscope, chrysotile asbestos fibers wrap around themselves in a spiral, which is why this form of asbestos is also called serpentine or curly asbestos.asbestos, also known as white asbestos, is the most common type of asbestos in industrial applications. When looked at under the microscope, chrysotile asbestos fibers wrap around themselves in a spiral, which is why this form of asbestos is also called or asbestos. Amphibole asbestos fibers are straight and needle-like. There are several types of amphibole fibers, including amosite (brown asbestos), crocidolite (blue asbestos), tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite.Both types of asbestos have been linked with cancer.Asbestos fibers can be useful because they are strong, resistant to heat and to many chemicals, and do not conduct electricity. As a result, asbestos has been used as an insulating material since ancient times. Since the industrial revolution, asbestos has been used to insulate factories, schools, homes, and ships, and to make automobile brake and clutch parts, roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, cement, textiles, and hundreds of other products.During the first half of the 20th century, growing evidence showed that breathing in asbestos caused scarring of the lungs. Exposure to asbestos dust in the workplace was not controlled at that time. Beginning in England in the 1930s, steps were taken to protect workers in the asbestos industry by installing ventilation and exhaust systems. However, in the huge shipbuilding effort during World War II, large numbers of workers were exposed to high levels of asbestos.As asbestos-related cancers became better recognized in the second half of the 20th century, measures were taken to reduce exposure, including establishing exposure standards and laws that banned the use of asbestos in construction materials. There has been a dramatic decrease in importing and using asbestos in the United States since the mid-1970s, and alternative insulating materials have been developed. As a result, asbestos exposure has dropped dramatically. However, its still used in some products, and its still possible to be exposed to asbestos in older buildings, water pipes, and other settings. Asbestos use has been banned in the European Union since 2005, although the ban did not require removal of asbestos that was already in place. Still, heavy asbestos use continues in some countries.How are people exposed to asbestos?People can be exposed to asbestos in different ways:Inhaling asbestos: Most exposures come from inhaling asbestos fibers in the air. This can occur during the mining and processing of asbestos, when making asbestos-containing products, or when installing asbestos insulation. It can also occur when older buildings are demolished or renovated, or when older asbestos-containing materials begin to break down. In any of these situations, asbestos fibers tend to create a dust made of tiny particles that can float in the air.Most exposures come from inhaling asbestos fibers in the air. This can occur during the mining and processing of asbestos, when making asbestos-containing products, or when installing asbestos insulation. It can also occur when older buildings are demolished or renovated, or when older asbestos-containing materials begin to break down. In any of these situations, asbestos fibers tend to create a dust made of tiny particles that can float in the air. Swallowing asbestos: Asbestos fibers can also be swallowed. This can happen when people consume contaminated food or liquids (such as water that flows through asbestos cement pipes). It can also occur when people cough up asbestos they have inhaled, and then swallow their saliva.Many people are exposed to very low levels of naturally occurring asbestos in outdoor air as a result of erosion of asbestos-containing rocks. The risk of this is higher in areas where rocks have higher asbestos content. In some areas, asbestos can be detected in the water supply as well as in the air. It can get into the water through several sources, such as rock or soil erosion, corrosion of asbestos cement pipes, or the breakdown of roofing materials containing asbestos that then enter the sewers after it rains.However, the people with the heaviest exposure are those who worked in asbestos industries, such as shipbuilding and insulation. Many of these people recall working in thick clouds of asbestos dust, day after day.Family members of asbestos workers can also be exposed to high levels of asbestos because the fibers can be carried home on the workers clothing, and can then be inhaled by others in the household.Asbestos exposure is also a concern in older buildings. If building materials that contain asbestos (like older insulation and ceiling and floor tiles) begin to decompose over time, asbestos fibers can be found in indoor air and may pose a health threat. There is no health risk if the asbestos is bonded into intact finished products, such as walls and tiles. As long as the material is not damaged or disturbed (for example, by drilling or remodeling), the fibers are not released into the air. Maintenance workers who sweep up and dispose of the asbestos dust or handle damaged asbestos-containing materials are often exposed to higher levels than other people in these buildings. Removing asbestos from homes and other buildings can also cause some exposure, although modern asbestos abatement workers are trained to use proper protective equipment to minimize exposure.Although use of asbestos has declined in the United States, people can still be exposed to asbestos in the workplace. In recent years, the US Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has estimated that over a million American employees in construction and general industries face significant asbestos exposure on the job.The mining and use of asbestos is also still a health hazard in some other parts of the world. Mining in the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Canada, and Zimbabwe accounts for almost all of the world production of asbestos. Much of what is produced is used in the Russian Federation (and other countries in the former Soviet Union) and Asia, and its use is on the rise in some areas. In 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that about 125 million people worldwide were exposed to asbestos at work, despite the known links to cancer and other lung diseases for more than 60 years.Does asbestos cause cancer?Researchers use 2 main types of studies to try to figure out if a substance causes cancer.Studies in people: One type of study looks at cancer rates in different groups of people. Such a study might compare the cancer rate in a group exposed to a substance to the cancer rate in a group not exposed to it, or compare it to the cancer rate in the general population. But sometimes it can be hard to know what the results of these studies mean, because many other factors might affect the results.One type of study looks at cancer rates in different groups of people.

But sometimes it can be hard to know what the results of these studies mean, because many other factors might affect the results. Lab studies: In studies done in the lab, animals are exposed to a substance (often in very large doses) to see if it causes tumors or other health problems. Researchers might also expose normal cells in a lab dish to the substance to see if it causes the types of changes that are seen in cancer cells. Its not always clear if the results from these types of studies will apply to humans, but lab studies are a good way to find out if a substance might possibly cause cancer.In most cases neither type of study provides enough evidence on its own, so researchers usually look at both human and lab-based studies when trying to figure out if something causes cancer.Evidence from studies in both people and lab animals has shown that asbestos can increase the risk for some types of cancer.When asbestos fibers in the air are inhaled, they can stick to mucus in the throat, trachea (windpipe), or bronchi (large breathing tubes of the lungs) and might be cleared by being coughed up or swallowed. But some fibers reach the ends of the small airways in the lungs or penetrate into the outer lining of the lung and chest wall (known as the pleura). These fibers can irritate the cells in the lung or pleura and eventually cause lung cancer or mesothelioma.Studies in peopleLung cancerInhalation of asbestos fibers has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in many studies of asbestos-exposed workers. This increased risk is seen with all forms of asbestos (there is no safe type of asbestos in terms of lung cancer risk). In general, the greater the exposure to asbestos, the higher the risk of lung cancer. Most cases of lung cancer in asbestos workers occur at least 15 years after first exposure to asbestos.In workers exposed to asbestos who also smoke, the lung cancer risk is even greater than adding the risks from these exposures separately.MesotheliomaMesothelioma is a fairly rare form of cancer that most often affects the thin linings of the organs in the chest (pleura) and abdomen (peritoneum).Mesothelioma is closely linked with asbestos exposure. All forms of asbestos have been linked to mesothelioma, although amphibole asbestos appears to cause this cancer at lower levels of exposure than chrysotile asbestos.Most cases of mesothelioma result from exposure to asbestos at work. There is also an increased risk of mesothelioma among family members of workers and people living in neighborhoods near asbestos factories and mines. Although the risk of mesothelioma increases with the amount of asbestos exposure, there is no clear safe level of asbestos exposure in terms of mesothelioma risk.Mesotheliomas typically take a long time to develop. The time between first exposure to asbestos and diagnosis of mesothelioma is usually 30 years or more. Unfortunately, the risk of mesothelioma does not drop with time after exposure to asbestos. The risk appears to be lifelong.Unlike lung cancer, mesothelioma risk is not increased among smokers.Other types of cancerStudies have also found clear links between workplace exposure to asbestos and cancers of the larynx (voice box) and ovaries.Some studies have also suggested that workplace asbestos exposure may be linked to other cancers, including cancers of the pharynx (throat), stomach, colon, and rectum. However, the link between these cancers and asbestos is not as clear as it is for the other cancers discussed here. For cancer of the throat, the link is strongest for the hypopharynx, the part of the throat closest to the larynx (voice box). Its not clear exactly how asbestos might affect risk for these cancers, but swallowed asbestos fibers might somehow contribute to the risk.Studies done in the labTests on several different rodent species, using different methods of exposure, have confirmed that asbestos causes cancer in animals. All forms of asbestos have produced tumors in animals, but the size and shape of the asbestos fibers influence the incidence of tumors. Smaller, straighter fibers seem more hazardous, perhaps because they are more likely to reach the deepest parts of the lungs.What expert agencies saySeveral national and international agencies study substances in the environment to determine if they can cause cancer. (A substance that causes cancer or helps cancer grow is called a carcinogen.) The American Cancer Society looks to these organizations to evaluate the risks based on evidence from laboratory, animal, and human research studies.Based on animal and human evidence like the examples above, several expert agencies have evaluated the cancer-causing nature of asbestos.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). One of its goals is to identify causes of cancer. IARC classifies asbestos as carcinogenic to humans, based on its ability to cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx (voice box), and ovaries.The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP has classified asbestos as known to be a human carcinogen.The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an electronic database that contains information on human health effects from exposure to various substances in the environment. The EPA classifies asbestos as a human carcinogen.(For more information on the classification systems used by these agencies, see Known and Probable Human Carcinogens.)Does asbestos cause any other health problems?The major health problem caused by asbestos exposure, aside from cancer, is a lung disease called asbestosis. When a person breathes high levels of asbestos over time, some of the fibers lodge deep in the lungs. Irritation caused by the fibers can eventually lead to scarring (fibrosis) in the lungs. This can make it hard to breathe. The main symptoms of asbestosis are shortness of breath and a chronic cough.When asbestosis occurs, it is typically 10 to 20 years after the initial exposure to asbestos. The disease can get worse over time. While some people may not have serious symptoms, others may be seriously disabled by breathing problems. Unfortunately there is no effective treatment for this disease.Asbestos can also reach the outer lining of the lungs (pleura), where it can cause pleural plaques (areas of hard, scar-like tissue in the pleura), pleural thickening, and pleural effusions (buildup of fluid between the lungs and the pleura). All of these conditions can make it harder to breathe.How can I avoid exposure to asbestos?If there is a possibility you might be exposed to asbestos at work, such as during renovating old buildings, you should use the proper protective equipment, work practices, and safety procedures designed for working around asbestos. If youre concerned about asbestos exposure in your workplace, discuss the situation with your employee health and safety representative or your employer. If needed, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), the federal agency responsible for health and safety regulations in most workplaces, can provide more information or make an inspection.If you live in an older home, it might contain asbestos-containing insulation or other materials. A knowledgeable expert can check your home to determine if there is any asbestos and if it poses any risk of exposure. This may involve testing the air for asbestos levels. (Again, just because asbestos exists in a home does not necessarily mean that it needs to be removed. As long as the material is not damaged or disturbed, for example by drilling or remodeling, the fibers are not released into the air.) If asbestos needs to be removed from your home, hire a qualified contractor to perform this job to avoid contaminating your home further or causing any exposure to your family or to the workers. You should not attempt to remove asbestos-containing material yourself.What should I do if Ive been exposed to asbestos?If youve been exposed to asbestos, its important to assess the amount of your exposure. If you were exposed only very briefly, or only at very low levels, your risk of a resulting disease is probably low. However, it you were exposed at high levels or for long periods of time, you may be at increased risk of certain cancers or the other diseases discussed above. You can help protect your health in several ways:If you are a smoker, its very important that you try to stop smoking. Evidence suggests that asbestos-exposed workers who quit smoking can significantly reduce their risk of developing lung cancer.Talk to your doctor about whether you should get regular health checkups to look for signs of asbestos-related diseases. This is especially important if you are a smoker. You may want to ask about seeing a doctor experienced with asbestos-related diseases. Some doctors recommend that people with heavy asbestos exposure get regular chest x-rays or CT scans and lung function tests. These tests cant detect asbestos fibers themselves, but they can sometimes find problems, including some cancers, that could be caused by the fibers. In fact, some expert groups advise that asbestos exposure alone is enough to consider getting regular CT scans to screen for lung cancer, regardless of a persons smoking history.Tell your doctor if you start to have symptoms that might be related to asbestos exposure such as shortness of breath, a new or worsening cough, coughing up blood, pain or tightness in the chest, trouble swallowing, or unintended weight loss. See your doctor promptly for any respiratory illness.Ask your doctor about getting vaccines against flu and pneumonia.If youve already been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease, there are some places you may be able to go for financial help with treatment. Some people with asbestos-related illness may be eligible for Medicare coverage. Some people also may qualify for help, including medical payments, under different workers compensation programs. These can include state workers compensation programs, the Federal Employees Compensation Program, and the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program. Eligible veterans may receive health care at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center for asbestos-related diseases.",Asbestos and Cancer Risk,,,context,context,n,,192,

She moved hundreds of books and loads of supplies into the gym, where parents and other community members took what they wanted. The rest was tossed in the trash.She also dumped boxes of newly purchased reading books in the basement because she preferred another curriculum, staffers said.Kim bought seven 70- to 80-inch Sharp flat-screen smart TVs, which retail at about $3,000 each. After painting over and removing historic murals, she had the TVs mounted in the auditorium  three over the stage and two on each side.It was ridiculous, Ferrer said. They have never been used.Kim holds a lottery for students to get academic assistance after school or on Saturdays. She also started a professional learning period in which teachers observe each other in class, but it eliminates one period of core instruction a week for students, staffers said.Kim recently told staff that Chancellor Carmen Faria praised PS 169 at a town hall meeting.","School principal bans Santa, Thanksgiving and Pledge of Allegiance",12/13/15,December,right,right,n,,194,

Over the next decade, the national debt is projected to nearly overtake the countrys economy. Congress should take steps to drive down spending nowincluding through reform of entitlement programsto a balanced budget, while maintaining a strong national defense, without raising taxes. Congress should also commit to conservative policy reforms focused on growing the economy, fostering free enterprise, limiting the size and role of the federal government, supporting civil society, and protecting individual freedom.While Congress cannot solve everything at once, it can and must seize opportunities through the annual budget and appropriations process to make a down payment on the governments growing debt, and to pursue conservative policy reforms. Congress can do this by immediately reducing discretionary spending, which has been inflated through irresponsible budget deals, and by taking meaningful steps to reduce mandatory spending by reforming autopilot entitlement programs.The Blueprint:BALANCES THE BUDGET WHILE REDUCING TAXES.In total, the Blueprint would reduce spending by more than $12.3 trillion over 10 years, reaching primary balance (without interest on the debt) within the first year, and eliminating deficits by 2025all that without counting any dynamic benefits from growing the economy. Including such effects would result in balance even sooner. The budget stays in surplus, allowing the nation to stabilize and begin paying down the national debt. It does this while permanently extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, thereby reducing taxes by over $400 billion.REFORMS ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS.Entitlement spending is growing on autopilot, consuming more and more of the federal budget each year. Tens of trillions in unfunded obligations are threatening younger generations with massive tax increases and undue burdens of debt. This Blueprint would repeal Obamacare; modernize Medicare by transitioning to a premium-support system and making key reforms to meet demographic, fiscal, and structural challenges; cap the federal allotment for Medicaid and give states greater flexibility in designing benefits and administering the program; and make commonsense reforms to Social Security and disability to protect seniors and individuals with disabilities from poverty while accounting for increased life expectancy, reforming eligibility criteria, modernizing the disability determination process, and reducing the overall cost of benefits.RESPONSIBLY BRINGS SPENDING UNDER CONTROL WHILE GROWING THE ECONOMY.The federal government cannot continue indefinitely to spend at a faster rate than the economy grows. Over the next decade, the proposed Heritage budget would reduce the growth in spending to an average rate of 3.1 percent annually, well below the nearly 5.5 percent annual growth rate under the CBOs baseline projection. Reducing spending alone is not the only component of a responsible budget. Growing the economy is another important aspect. Through spending reforms, as well as through tax and regulatory reforms, the Blueprint will also boost economic growth. Making the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent should produce economic growth that is roughly 2 percent higher than the CBO baseline. However, the Blueprint does not assume this additional growth, nor any dynamic scoring effects resulting from spending cuts and tax and regulatory reforms. If the budget utilized less conservative estimates, it would likely balance and reduce the debt at an even faster rate.REDUCES THE NATIONAL DEBT.The Blueprint would reduce debt held by the public by $6.8 trillion over the decade, when compared to current Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections. As a percentage of the economy, debt would fall from a projected 78.0 percent by the end of 2018 to 73.4 percent in 2028, and continue falling from there. In stark contrast, the CBO projects that if reforms are not made, debt would rise to 96.2 percent of the economy over the next 10 years.MAKES CIVIL SERVICE COMPENSATION COMPETITIVE.Federal employees as a whole receive significantly higher total compensation than similar private-sector employees. Yet the federal government is at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting highly skilled workers because it fails to tie pay to productivity. Moreover, excessive civil service protections prevent federal managers from firing or even stopping performance-based pay increases for underperforming employees. The Blueprint puts forth comprehensive civil service reforms including everything from pay and benefits to personnel policies and labor-management relations. Not only would these reforms provide employees with more competitive compensations packages, it would also save taxpayers $330 billion in excessive personnel costs.PURSUES ADDITIONAL TAX REFORMS.The U.S. tax codes complexity and structure harm economic growth. The 2017 tax reform began to address the most pressing problems, but much work remains to be done. The new lower tax rates and other changes in tax reform will increase productivity, job creation, and real wages. In the coming years, Congress should make the individual tax cuts permanent, expand the ability of businesses to fully expense their investments, and eliminate all special tax carve-outs. These changes will work to increase and solidify the economic gains from tax reform. This budget makes additional tax reform recommendations that Congress should pursue. Future tax reforms should further lower tax rates on all Americans and work to establish a consumption tax base rather than the hybrid income-consumption tax base that the current system uses. Expanding the use and availability of retirement-style savings accounts for all-purpose savings is a good first step toward the goal of eliminating the bias against saving and investment. Future reforms should also make the U.S. tax system more transparent and less complex so that taxpayers understand how much they are paying every year to fund the federal government.PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND STRENGTHENS CIVIL SOCIETY.The federal budget should reflect the principles of the American people within the constraints of constitutional government. The budget delineates priorities, clarifies positions on fundamental issues, reflects views on the role of the government, and provides insight into Americans moral character. At the most basic level, a budget is a plan to collect and allocate resources. However, it should also illustrate a commitment to individual rights as well as strengthening civil society. James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 58 that providing budgetary powers to Congress was a critical element in maintaining individual rights. The Blueprint provides Congress with specific legislative riders to advance these conservative ideals through the budget process.FULLY FUNDS NATIONAL DEFENSE.The Blueprint prioritizes national defense capabilities by moving resources from less critical domestic programs to funding the federal governments core constitutional role. With continued and rising global tensions likely to persist, sufficiently funding national defense and ensuring troop readiness must be a top priority.REINS IN INTEREST SPENDING.Net interest spending is projected to triple over the next decade if no action is taken. By 2023, the nation would be spending more on interest payments on the debt than on national defense. By stabilizing the debt, this budget reins in the cost of servicing the debt, freeing up resources for other national priorities and avoiding higher taxes.PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR BUDGET PROCESS REFORM.The Blueprint takes immediate steps toward implementing change in the budget process, making commonsense recommendations that the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform could adopt by the end of the year. These include: enacting a statutory spending cap enforced by sequestration to curb excessive spending growth; moving towards a balanced budget amendment to constrain future attempts at circumventing budget caps; eliminating the use of changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) as a tool to evade discretionary spending limits; stopping spending on unauthorized programs; putting government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) on budget to accurately account for the budgetary impacts and risks of these programs; accounting for interest costs when providing estimates of the fiscal impact of legislation; exempting conference reports from being subject to the Byrd Rule; and implementing use of fair-value accounting to more accurately report the risks that Congress assumes and the subsidies it provides through federal credit programs, such as student loans.INCLUDES NEW TRACKING FEATURE.In order to hold the Administration and lawmakers more accountable for pursuing important budget proposals, Heritage is introducing a new tracker to establish whether Blueprint proposals are included by the Administration and in select congressional budget proposals. Heritage tracks proposals in President Trumps budget, the House budget, the Senate budget, and the influential Republican Study Committee budget. For each proposal, Heritage analysts identified whether the budget proposal includes Heritage policy recommendations, partially includes them, does not address them, or rejects them. We hope that this tool will prove useful to lawmakers in identifying which budget proposals already enjoy broad support and which need more champions. Our other aim is to influence future budget proposals by encouraging the inclusion of yet more support for the recommendations made in the Blueprint for Balance.Explore the website",Blueprint for Balance: A Federal Budget for FY 2019,,The Heritage Foundation,context,context,n,,195,

Most species have an annual breeding season - spring through summer. The king penguin has the longest breeding cycle of all the penguin species, lasting 14 to 16 months. A female king penguin may produce a chick during alternate breeding seasons. Emperor penguins breed annually during the antarctic winter, June through August. During the emperor breeding season, air temperature may drop to -60C (-76F) and winds may reach speeds up to 200 kph (124 mph.) For most of the winter, antarctic penguins live in an environment of darkness or half-light. Why emperors breed during the harshest season of the year is unknown, but some scientists speculate that when the chicks become independent five months later (in January and February, the antarctic summer), environmental conditions are more favorable for the young birds. The little penguin breeds throughout the year and has the shortest breeding cycle, which lasts about 50 days. Some of the temperate penguins, like the Humboldt and the African, tend to nest throughout the year.Courtship. Courtship varies among species. It generally begins with both visual and auditory displays. In many species, males display first to establish a nest site and then to attract a mate. Not all species exhibit all displays, but in general there are three distinct types of displays. Ecstatic. Also called trumpeting, head swinging or advertisement, this display establishes possession of a nest site, attracts females, and warns other males to stay away. Males at the nest site commonly exhibit the ecstatic display before females arrive or when building nests. The male may dip its head low and then stretch its head and neck upward with flippers held outstretched and squawk or ""bray"". Male penguins can perform the ecstatic display in a sitting or standing position. Some species, like the Adlie, chinstrap, and crested penguins, may swing their head or flap their flippers while calling. Mutual ecstatic. Once paired, male and female penguins perform the mutual ecstatic display together. This display seems to strengthen the pair bond, coordinate nesting behavior, and advertise a nesting territory. The mutual display is similar to the ecstatic displayhead and neck stretched upward with a braying vocal. Crested, brush-tailed, and temperate penguins, stand facing each other, performing the action in unison. Within these species there are some behavior differences. For example, gentoos generally hold their outstretched head and flippers still, while macaronis flap flippers and roll their heads from side to side. Emperor penguins have a unique mutual display position: Standing face-to-face, individuals hold their heads down with bills pointed to the ground while braying. Mutual displays continue throughout the breeding season, often taking place at the nest when parents switch places for egg incubation and chick feeding. Bowing. Bowing displays may lessen the likelihood of aggression and strengthen recognition between partners. One or both of the penguins dips its head and points its bill at the nest or at the other bird's bill. The call is a low hiss or growl Crested penguins may vibrate their bills while pointing in a type of display called ""quivering.""Emperor and king penguins are the only known marine birds to reflect ultraviolet (UV) light from their bills, and a male king penguin's bill may be used as a cue in finding and selecting a mate. UV light, invisible to the human eye, can be perceived by most birds. UV reflection off the feathers of studied songbirds has been a recognized factor for mate selection. During courtship, king penguin males come face-to-face and flaunt their bills to possible mates. The strong contrast of the black background of their bills is believed to augment UV light reflection. The strong contrasting black background of this king penguin's bill is believed to augment UV light reflection.Most penguin species are monogamous (one male breeds with one female during a mating season); however, research has shown that some females may have one to three partners in one season and some males may have one or two partners.Mate selection is up to the female, and it is the females that compete for the males.In some penguin species, a female selects the same male from the preceding season to mate with. Adlie penguins have been documented re-pairing with the previous year's mate 62% of the time. Chinstraps re-paired in 82% of possible cases, and gentoos re-paired 90% of the time. In one study of Adlies, females paired with males within minutes of arriving at the colony.When a female selects a different mate it is usually because her mate from the previous season fails to return to the nesting area. Another reason may be mistiming in returning to the nesting area. If they arrive at different times and miss each other, one or both penguins may obtain new mates.Eudyptes penguins are closely related and some in this genus are known to crossbreed with different Eudyptes members. Rockhoppers are known to interbreed with macaroni, royal, and erect-crested penguins, for example, with matings producing hybrid offspring that in some cases have successfully reproduced as well.Nesting Nest site fidelity. Studies have shown that individuals of most penguin species return each year to the same rookeries. In addition, most penguins return to the same nesting site within the rookery. Studies have indicated that fidelity to the previous year's nest site was 99% for male Adlie penguins, 94% for chinstraps, and 63% for gentoos. Rockhoppers appear to have an amazingly precise breeding timetable, with males returning to the spot of their former nest virtually on the same day each year, regardless if weather or environmental factors have changed from the previous breeding season. Males arrive first to the rookeries to establish and defend their nesting sites. In a study on Adlie and chinstrap penguins, females arrived one day and five days after the males, respectively. When it is time to breed, mature birds return to the rookery where they hatched. This results in large numbers of penguins at a single rookery rather than penguins colonizing new areas. Some penguin rookeries number millions of birds. Various penguin species may share a particular rookery site. It is not uncommon to find gentoos nesting near Adlie and chinstrap penguins for example, but nesting areas within the rookery are kept segregated by each species.Nesting habitats vary among species. Emperor penguins form colonies on the Antarctic continent. They prefer sites on a fairly level surface of land-fast sea ice sheets in areas sheltered from wind, with easy access to feeding areas. Rookeries must be far enough inland that the ice does not melt under them prior to the chicks being ready to go to sea. King penguins nest and breed on subantarctic and antarctic islands. They prefer beaches and valleys of level ground or gentle slopes, free of snow and ice, and accessible to the sea. Adlies often nest 50 to 60 km (31.1-37.3 mi.) from the edge of the sea ice on the antarctic continent and nearby on rocky islands, peninsulas, beaches, hillsides, valleys, and other areas free of ice. Cape Adare is home to the largest single colony of Adlie penguins with an estimated population of 282,000 breeding pairs. Gentoo penguins nest in-land or on coastal peninsulas and islands. Gentoo penguin colonies can be inland or coastal on antarctic and subantarctic islands and peninsulas. They tend to breed on ice-free ground on beaches, in valleys, on inland hills, and on cliff tops. Chinstrap penguins nest on fairly steep slopes. Fiordland crested penguins nest in a wet, coastal rain forest habitat, under bushes, between tree roots, in holes, or on rocky coasts among rocks or in caves. Galpagos penguins nest in volcanic caves or cracks in rock. The South Sandwich Islands have the largest population of nesting chinstraps with an estimated 5 million pairs. Temperate penguins nest in underground burrows. The temperate penguins and the little penguin often nest underground in burrows, rock crevices, caves, under shrubs, or in scrapes in the ground. These species breed in areas where the climate can range from tropical to subantarctic. Underground or other sheltered burrows provide an environment with a relatively constant air temperature for the eggs and chicks. Some Humboldt penguins burrow and create nesting sites in guano (fecal) deposits.Nesting materials vary from species to species and from location to location. Adlies build nests of small stones that they use to line depressions in the ground. Some chinstrap and gentoos also construct nests out of stones. The stones help keep the eggs above the surface when the rookery floods from melting snow. Adlie, gentoo, and chinstrap penguins are known to take stones from other nests. A penguin returning to the nest sometimes brings its mate a stone as a courtship gesture. Chinstrap penguins usually construct nests with perimeters of eight to ten stones, just enough to prevent eggs from rolling away. Gentoo penguins use nesting materials ranging from pebbles and molted feathers in Antarctica to vegetation on subantarctic islands. One medium-sized gentoo nest was composed of 1,700 pebbles and 70 molted tail feathers. Male and female Adlie penguins build their nests out of pebbles, bones, and moss. This gentoo penguin has constructed its nest out of pebbles. Emperor and king penguins build no nests. They stand upright while incubating a single egg on the tops of their feet under a loose fold of abdominal. Under this loose fold is a featherless patch of skin called a brood patch, which occurs in all incubating birds. The brood patch contains numerous blood vessels that, when engorged with blood, transfer body heat to the eggs.Eggs Eggs may be white to bluish or greenish. The shape varies among species. In Humboldt and Adlie penguins the egg is more or less round. In emperor and king penguins the egg is rather pear-shaped, with one end tapering almost to a point. With this elliptical shape, if an egg falls off of the feet of a parent bird, the egg will roll in a circle instead of away from the parent.Penguin eggs from left to right: gentoo, king, and emperor. Gentoo penguins construct nests; however, king and emperor penguins incubate eggs on the tops of their feet. The elliptical shape fits snugly. In addition, if the egg happens to fall off, it will roll in a circle instead of a straight line away from the parent. Egg size and weight varies with species. From the records of SeaWorld's successful penguin breeding programs, emperor penguin eggs measure 11.1 to 12.7 cm (4.4-5 in.) long and weigh 345 to 515 g (12.1-18 oz.), and Adlie penguin eggs measure 5.5 to 8.6 cm (2.2-3.4 in.) long and weigh 61 to 153.5 g (2.1-5.4 oz.) A nest of eggs is called a clutch, and with the exception of emperor and king penguins, clutches usually contain two eggs. (Emperor and king penguins lay a single egg.) A clutch with more than one egg presents a better chance of at least one chick surviving.",Reproduction,,Seaworld Parks,debunking,context,context,,199,

Borra and Eric Trottier This graph shows the number of detected signals by Spectral Type of star. Credit: Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier We all want there to be aliens. Green ones, pink ones, brown ones, Greys. Or maybe Vulcans, Klingons, even a being of pure energy. Any type will do.That's why whenever a mysterious signal or energetic fluctuation arrives from somewhere in the cosmos and hits one of our many telescopes, headlines erupt across the media: ""Have We Finally Detected An Alien Signal?"" or ""Have Astronomers Discovered An Alien Megastructure?"" But science-minded people know that we're probably getting ahead of ourselves.Skepticism still rules the day when it comes to these headlines, and the events that spawn them. That's the way it should be, because we've always found a more prosaic reason for whatever signal from space we're talking about. But, being skeptical is a balancing act; it doesn't mean being dismissive.What we're talking about here is a new study from E.F. Borra and E. Trottier, two astronomers at Laval University in Canada. Their study, titled ""Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars"" was just published at arXiv.org. ArXiv.org is a pre-print website, so the paper itself hasn't been peer reviewed yet. But it is generating interest.The two astronomers used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and analyzed the spectra of 2.5 million stars. Of all those stars, they found 234 stars that are producing a puzzling signal. That's only a tiny percentage. And, they say, these signals ""have exactly the shape of an ETI signal"" that was predicted in a previous study by Borra.This graph shows the number of detected signals by Spectral Type of star. Credit: Ermanno F. Borra and Eric TrottierPrediction is a key part of the scientific method. If you develop a theory, your theory looks better and better the more you can use it to correctly predict some future events based on it. Look how many times Einstein's predictions based on Relativity have been proven correct.The 234 stars in Borra and Trottier's study aren't random. They're ""overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1 spectral range"" according to the abstract. That's significant because this is a small range centred around the spectrum of our own Sun. And our own Sun is the only one we know of that has an intelligent species living near it. If ours does, maybe others do too?The authors acknowledge five potential causes of their findings: instrumental and data reduction effects, rotational transitions in molecules, the Fourier transform of spectral lines, rapid pulsations, and finally the ETI signal predicted by Borra (2012). They dismiss molecules or pulsations as causes, and they deem it highly unlikely that the signals are caused by the Fourier analysis itself. This leaves two possible sources for the detected signals. Either they're a result of the Sloan instrument itself and the data reduction, or they are in fact a signal from extra-terrestrial intelligences.The detected signals are pulses of light separated by a constant time interval. These types of signals were predicted by Borra in his 2012 paper, and they are what he and Trottier set out to find in the Sloan data. It may be a bit of a red flag when scientist's find the very thing they predicted they would find. But Trottier and Borra are circumspect about their own results.As the authors say in their paper, ""Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars."" It may be unlikely, but lots of discoveries seem unlikely at first. Maybe there is a tiny subset of stars with chemical peculiarities that make them act in this way.A portion of the 234 stars that are sources of the pulsed ETI-like signal. Note that all the stars are in the narrow spectral range F2 to K1, very similar to our own sun. Credit: Image: Ermanno F. Borra and Eric TrottierTo sum it all up, the two astronomers have found a tiny number of stars, very similar to our own Sun, that seem to be the source of pulsed signals. These signals are the same as predicted if a technological society was using powerful lasers to communicate with distant stars.We all want there to be aliens, and maybe the first sign of them will be pulsed light signals from stars like our own sun. But it's all still very preliminary, and as the authors acknowledge, ""at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work.""That further work is already being planned by the Breakthrough Listen Initiative, a project that searches for intelligent life in the cosmos. They plan to use the Automated Planet Finder telescope at the Lick Observatory to further observe some of Borra's 234 stars.The Breakthrough team don't seem that excited about Borra's findings. They've already poured cold water on it, trotting out the old axiom that ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" in a statement on Borra's paper. They also give Borra's findings a score of 0 to 1 on the Rio Scale. The Rio Scale is something used by the international SETI community to rank detections of phenomena that could indicate advanced life beyond Earth. A rating of 0 to 1 means its insignificant.Better rein in the headline writers.Explore further: Astronomers detect ultra-weak magnetic fields in two metallic-line stars","Either stars are strange, or there are 234 aliens trying to contact us",,,right,context,right,,205,

Jan. 11, 2018  Today, Walmart announced plans to increase the starting wage rate for all hourly associates in the U.S. to $11, expand maternity and parental leave benefits and provide a one-time cash bonus for eligible associates of up to $1,000. The company is also creating a new benefit to assist associates with adoption expenses. The combined wage and benefit changes will benefit the companys more than one million U.S. hourly associates.Today, we are building on investments weve been making in associates, in their wages and skills development, said Doug McMillon, Walmart president and CEO. Its our people who make the difference and we appreciate how they work hard to make every day easier for busy families.He added, We are early in the stages of assessing the opportunities tax reform creates for us to invest in our customers and associates and to further strengthen our business, all of which should benefit our shareholders. However, some guiding themes are clear and consistent with how weve been investing -- lower prices for customers, better wages and training for associates and investments in the future of our company, including in technology. Tax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.This increase in wages to associates will take effect in February and will be approximately $300 million incremental to what was already included in next fiscal years plan. The one-time bonus represents an additional payment to associates of approximately $400 million in the current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 31, 2018.While the new law will create some financial benefit for the company, Walmart is early in the process of assessing potential additional investments. That assessment will be done not only through the lens of associates, customers and shareholders, but also within Walmarts financial framework of strong, efficient growth, consistent operating discipline and strategic capital allocation. Further details will be shared, as appropriate, when the company releases quarterly results Feb. 20, 2018.Associates will hear more from their managers in the coming days about details.But, broadly, associates in the U.S. will share in tax savings through:A one-time bonus benefiting all eligible full and part-time hourly associates in the U.S. The amount of the bonus will be based on length of service, with associates with at least 20 years qualifying for $1,000. A discrete one-time charge will be taken in the fourth quarter of the current year to account for the bonus; qualification will be determined before the end of the month and payments will be paid as quickly as practical thereafter.An increase in Walmarts starting wage rate to $11 an hour, effective in the Feb. 17, 2018, pay cycle. The change is in addition to wage increases already planned for many U.S. markets in the coming fiscal year. The increase applies to all hourly associates in the U.S., including stores, Sams Clubs, eCommerce, logistics and Home Office.An expanded parental and maternity leave policy, providing full-time hourly associates in the U.S. with 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave. Salaried associates will also receive six weeks of paid parental leave.Walmart will provide financial assistance to associates adopting a child. The adoption benefit, available to both full-time hourly and salaried associates, will total $5,000 per child and may be used for expenses such as adoption agency fees, translation fees and legal or court costs.Two associates working on a pizza in deli Restocking onions Associate smiles while restocking packaged ham Tire & Lube Express Associate secures a tire Associate stocks produce near the Organic section Associate Scanning items on the shelves Cashier at Walmart Supercenter Associate Smiles While Counting Money Pick up associate Associate opening door in the juice section Neighborhood Market associate scans items Smiling Associate with Customer at Checkout An associate gets ready to bag organic tomatoes for grocery pickup An associate scans ice cream for grocery pickup Associate pulls pick up grocery items in the soda aisle An associate helps a customer with grocery pickup from vehicle Associate and customer in electronic department Associate working with flowers in center aisle A Walmart associate moves shopping carts 1 of 19About WalmartWal-Mart Stores, Inc.

It is currently the fourth most popular type of fish behind tuna, salmon and Alaskan pollock, and the third most popular aquaculture or farm raised seafood product behind shrimp and salmon. Since 2006, Americans have consumed over 1 pound of tilapia per person each year. Predictions suggest it will remain a popular selection due to its mild flavor and taste, versatility in preparation, and competitive prices.Types and Sources of ProductsTilapia is probably the oldest farm raised fish in the world. Stories from biblical scholars suggest it was the fish used by Jesus to feed the crowds at the Sea of Galilee, the so-called St. Peters Fish. Today, over 80 nations produce farm-raised tilapia including the United States. China is the largest producer accounting for over 50 percent of the worlds production.There are many different species of tilapia. Aquaculture producers have developed various breeds or hybrids that grow efficiently to market size and have desirable appearance and flavor characteristics. The approved market name for all varieties is Tilapia, and the three primary species in the marketplace are: Nile or Black tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Blue tilapia (O. aureus), and Mozambique or red tilapia (O. mossambicus). Although the species names imply different colors, the edible fillets or portions are very similar and more influenced by growing conditions and feeds than external colors.Tilapia is a hardy herbivorous fish that feeds on algae or small aquatic plant cells, and is primarily raised in freshwater systems using cages, ponds, raceways or open waters. The water conditions in the farming operations have an important impact on product quality and taste. Tilapia has been called the aqua-chicken because of the breeding improvements and mass production methods that evoke comparisons to the land based chicken industry in the United States. Organic production methods for tilapia have been developed and some producers are seeking official recognition for their products.Product Forms and Buyer AdviceTilapia is popular because it is a mild flavored, white-fleshed fish that is available throughout the year at a competitive price. The most popular product form is skinless and boneless fillets ranging in size from 3 to 9 ounces (5 to 7 ounce fillets are the most common). Various processing and packaging methods are used to ensure that fillets have a mild flavor and retain their bright red color. During the early years of production, tilapia from some sources had unpredictable off-flavors that were associated with water conditions and certain types of algae from different freshwater farming operations. However, recent production improvements have introduced methods to prevent the development of off flavors and screen products to ensure that flavors are uniform.As the tilapia market has grown, some efforts to creatively market this species or illegally change its name to something more appealing such as sunshine snapper, cherry snapper and pink snapper have occurred. Substituting tilapia for a more valuable species is also illegal, but stands as testimony to its quality attributes.Nutrition InformationTilapia has a low to moderate fat content, and is a rich source of high quality protein. A nutrition label for a 3 ounce cooked portion of tilapia is provided. Nutrient levels can be affected by the ingredients and cooking method used to prepare tilapia fillets.Sustainability and ManagementTilapia is a sustainable farm-raised product. Because tilapia are herbivorous fish that feed on algae, there is no need for feeds produced from wild caught fish. Raising tilapia in some ponds or other small water bodies can actually help improve the quality of waters compromised by excessive algae blooms. Some farming operations are using a technique called aquaponics to cultivate fish and vegetables or herbs together to produce two or more products in the same water based system.ReferencesNational Marine Fisheries Service, 2011.

It is also registered for use as a mosquito adulticide, and for use in roach and ant bait stations in child resistant packaging.Products are sold as liquids, granules, water dispersible granules, wettable powders, and water soluble packets, and may be applied by either ground or aerial equipment.Top of PageUsing Chlorpyrifos Products SafelyThe current chlorpyrifos labels require workers handling and applying chlorpyrifos to wear additional personal protective equipment (chemical resistant gloves, coveralls, respirators), and restricting entry into treated fields for 24 hours up to five days.Chlorpyrifos can cause cholinesterase inhibition in humans at high enough doses; that is, it can overstimulate the nervous system causing nausea, dizziness, confusion, and at very high exposures (e.g., accidents or major spills), respiratory paralysis and death.Top of PageEPA Actions and Regulatory HistorySince its first registration in 1965, chlorpyrifos has been reviewed by EPA for tolerance reassessment, reregistration, and most recently, as part of its ongoing registration review. The following timeline summarizes the work EPA has done to ensure that as science and technology evolve registered chlorpyrifos products remain safe for use.2000  Voluntary Agreement to Eliminate, Phase Out and Modify Certain UsesIn 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act set a more stringent safety standard to be especially protective of children. After finalizing the chlorpyrifos risk assessments for reregistration, EPA identified the need to modify certain chlorpyrifos uses to meet the revised standard of safety, and to address health and environmental risks from chlorpyrifos exposure. In 2000, the registrants of chlorpyrifos voluntarily entered into an agreement with EPA to eliminate, phase out, and modify certain uses. Some examples of the voluntary cancellations and modifications in the agreement include:Eliminating most homeowner uses, except ant and roach baits in child resistant packaging and fire ant mound treatments, and phasing out all termiticide uses.Discontinuing all uses of chlorpyrifos products in the United States on tomatoes, restricting use on apples to pre-bloom and dormant application, and lowering the grape tolerance (maximum residue level) to reflect the labeled dormant application.Read the 2006 Registration Eligibility Decision (RED) for chlorpyrifos, which finalized the 2002 Interim RED, and includes an overview of the chlorpyrifos human health risk assessment for reregistration.2002  Label Changes to Ensure Environmental and Worker SafetyIn 2002, EPA made a number of changes to the required safety measures that improved safety for the environment and for those applying this pesticide including:Use of buffer zones to protect water quality, fish and wildlife;Reductions in application rates per season on a variety of crops including citrus and corn; andIncrease in amount of personal protective equipment to mitigate risk to agricultural workers.2011  Preliminary Human Health Risk AssessmentIn 2011, as part of the registration review process, EPA completed a comprehensive preliminary human health risk assessment for all chlorpyrifos uses. This assessment included the results of extensive new research and the findings of a number of new studies that had become available since the agencys last human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos, completed in June 2000.Read the 2011 human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos.2012  Spray Drift Mitigation and Changes to Application RatesIn 2012, EPA significantly lowered the aerial pesticide application rates and created no-spray buffer zones for ground, airblast and aerial application methods around public spaces, including recreational areas, schools, homes and other sensitive areas to be protective of children and other bystanders.Read the 2012 Spray Drift Mitigation Decision for chlorpyrifos.2014  Revised Human Health Risk AssessmentIn 2014, as part of the registration review process, EPA completed a revised human health risk assessment for all chlorpyrifos uses. The assessment updated the June 2011 preliminary human health risk assessment based on new information received, including public comments. EPA factored in exposures from multiple sources including from the exposures from food and water, from inhaling the pesticide and through the skin. EPA considered all populations including infants, children, and women of child-bearing age. EPA incorporated information from a 2012 assessment of spray drift exposure and as well as new restrictions put into place to limit spray drift.Read the 2014 human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos.2016  Revised Human Health Risk AssessmentAfter receiving public comments on the 2014 risk assessment and feedback from the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel, EPA revised its human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos in 2016.Read the 2016 human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos.2017  Denial of Petition to Revoke TolerancesIn March 2017, EPA denied a petition that asked us to revoke all pesticide tolerances (maximum residue levels in food) for chlorpyrifos and cancel all chlorpyrifos registrations. The Agency concluded that despite several years of study, the science addressing neurodevelopmental effects remains unresolved and further evaluation of the science during the remaining time for completion of registration review is warranted. As a part of the ongoing registration review, we will continue to review the science addressing neurodevelopmental effects of chlorpyrifos.Read the Federal Register notice announcing our response to the petition.Top of PageRegistration Review ScheduleCurrently, chlorpyrifos remains registered as it undergoes registration review, a program that re-evaluates all pesticides on a 15-year cycle. Registration review ensures pesticides will not cause unreasonable adverse effects when used according to label directions and precautions and that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from dietary and residential exposure. All documents related to the registration review can be located in the registration review docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0850 located at www.regulations.gov. We will continue to evaluate the potential risks posed by chlorpyrifos as part of the ongoing registration review and intend to complete our assessment by the statutory deadline of October 1, 2022.

The courts decision was narrow, and it left open the larger question of whether a business can discriminate against gay men and lesbians based on rights protected by the First Amendment.The court passed on an opportunity to either bolster the right to same-sex marriage or explain how far the government can go in regulating businesses run on religious principles. Instead, Justice Anthony M. Kennedys majority opinion turned on the argument that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which originally ruled against the baker, had been shown to be hostile to religion because of the remarks of one of its members.At the same time, Justice Kennedy strongly reaffirmed protections for gay rights.The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, he wrote, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.Justice Kennedy often casts the deciding vote in closely divided cases on major social issues. When the court agreed to hear the Colorado case last June, it seemed to present him with a stark choice between two of his core commitments. On the one hand, Justice Kennedy has written every major Supreme Court decision protecting gay men and lesbians.

Many parents feel if the school is heading in a different direction then the San Domenico community should have been notified before the signing of the enrollment for the following year.Cheryl Newell, who had four children graduate from San Domenico, said, I am extremely disappointed in the school and the direction theyve been going. This isnt a new thing that theyve been intentionally eroding their Catholic heritage. Theyre trying to be something for everyone and theyre making no one happy,CeremonyKim Pipki, whose daughter left San Domenico two years ago after graduating from ninth grade, said some of the statues were also important to families who arent Catholic.The one main statue that has everyone fired up is the baby Jesus and Mary one, Pipki said. It was at the center of the primary school courtyard.Pipki said the school had a ceremony during which children would place a crown on the statue of Mary.It was less about God and more about passing on some traditions, Pipki said. People were shocked that the statues were pitched in the basement.Amy Skewes-Cox, who heads San Domenico Schools board of trustees, said the relocation and removal of some of the schools 180 religious icons was completely in compliance with San Domenicos new strategic plan, approved unanimously by the board of trustees and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael last year. She said at least 18 icons remain, including a statue of St. Dominic at the center of the campus.AdvertisementShe noted that it was unfortunate the removal of the statues occurred at about the same time as the unrest in Charlottesville over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and that the issues are totally different and have absolutely no connection other than it is change, and people have a hard time with change.All faithsSister Maureen McInerney, prioress general of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael, said she hadnt visited the campus lately and was under the impression statues had been relocated on campus rather than removed entirely.I try not to get into the details of the operation. That really isnt my place, McInerney said. So if there has been a reduction in the number of statues but there are still many statues around the campus, I think that would be fine.San Domenico is a Catholic school; it also welcomes people of all faiths, McInerney said. It is making an effort to be inclusive of all faiths.One of the strategic plans stated goals is to strengthen San Domenicos identity as an independent school and clearly articulate its inclusive spiritual foundation.San Domenico was founded by the Dominican Sisters in 1850 as an independent, Catholic school  meaning that it is not owned or operated by a parish or religious order.San Domenico is both a Catholic school and an independent school, said Head of School Cecily Stock, but what we were finding after doing some research is that in the broader community we are known as being a Catholic school and are not necessarily known as an independent school. We want to make sure that prospective families are aware that we are an independent school.No catechismOf the 660 students who attend the K-12 school, 121 are boarding students and 98 of these are international students from British Columbia, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Mexico, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. The students attending San Domenico come from a variety of religious backgrounds besides Christianity: Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.Stock said schools operated by the Catholic Church, such as St. Isabella, Marin Catholic and St. Anselm, tend to have larger class sizes and lower tuition costs. Tuition for an incoming kindergarten student at San Domenico is $29,850.Skewes-Cox said, If you walk on the campus and the first thing you confront is three or four statues of St. Dominic or St. Francis, it could be alienating for that other religion, and we didnt want to further that feeling.Stock said the parents of some prospective students who visited the campus expressed concern about this.In her email to the school, Fitzpatrick wrote that she became concerned with the direction of San Domenico when it removed first reconciliation and first communion from the second-grade curriculum, last year.Stock said the year before last the school began offering catechism after school and then last year phased it out entirely.We had very few families interested. I think last year it was fewer than five, Stock said. It just made sense to have the students prepare for communion with their local parishes where they would be with a larger group of students.Stock said, Over the last few years weve had fewer Catholic students as part of the community and a larger number of students of various faith traditions. Right now about 80 percent of our families do not identify as Catholic.World religionsRather than indoctrinate students in Catholic theology, San Domenico provides students with instruction in world religions and philosophy.Its really about empowering each student and giving them the information so they can discover their own purpose, their own truth, Stock said. We believe the best way to understand your own faith is to learn about the faiths of others.Mirza Khan, the schools director of philosophy, ethics and world religions, said, The Dominican teaching philosophy is not to teach there is only one truth. It is to foster conversation, to intentionally invite in participants that have different perspectives in a very open-ended process of philosophical and spiritual inquiry. That has been a long-standing part of the Dominican tradition.Khan, whose father and grandfather were Sufi teachers in India, received a bachelors degree in comparative religion at Bard College. Before becoming a teacher at San Domenico about 10 years ago, he worked as a research assistant to a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.Khan said during his time in Jerusalem he got to see first-hand how devastating it can be when religions are in conflict.",San Anselmos San Domenico School creates stir by removing Catholic statues,8/29/17,,right,right,n,,218,

This is good business for us, said Cindy Ortega, chief sustainability officer at MGM Resorts. We are looking at leaving the power system, and one of the reasons for that is we can procure more renewable energy on the open market.But there is a big shadow lurking over a rapid greening of the Las Vegas strip. Regulators will not let casinos simply walk away from the states monopoly utility provider, NV Energy.Together, the casinos 15 properties account for 7% of NV Energys electricity sales, and if that income were lost, the utility says, its remaining customers would have to endure significant rate hikes. As a result, the public utility commission (PUC) of Nevada is demanding resorts pay tens of millions of dollars to leave NV Energys services, a December 2015 decision which one casino has appealed.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Solar panels being installed on the Mandalay Bay convention center. Photograph: MGM ResortsLas Vegass power drama captures an ongoing dilemma in the new energy economy. While corporations have been encouraged to go green, their efforts pass the burden of subsidizing old utility regimes on to retail consumers, which regulators cannot allow.Its no accident that we put the [solar] array on top of a conference center. This is good business for us Cindy Ortega, MGM ResortsThey need to maintain the grid. You cannot let these utilities go bankrupt or else every business in the city dies, said Bill Ellard, an energy economist for the American Solar Energy Society. What will happen if they dont maintain the grid properly and the transformers blow?In December, Nevadas three-member PUC effectively destroyed a thriving rooftop solar industry by approving NV Energys request to drastically lower the rate at which solar users are compensated for excess energy they provide to the grid.This is what I call a death spiral for utilities, said Ellard. They make it hard to go solar because once you defect from them, that affects revenue. Then they increase rates on everybody else, forcing them to defect.MGM Resorts has already hurt utility profits though an ambitious energy conservation effort. In addition to building a solar array strong enough to power 1,000 homes for one year, the corporation is replacing 1.3m light bulbs in its properties with LEDs.But to power multi-thousand-room resorts which house nightclubs, pools, theaters and slot machine-packed casinos would require more solar panels than the companies have rooftop space. They are consequently joining a trend in big energy consumers requesting to buy electricity outside the utility system.They are all very concerned with their bottom lines, said Rebecca Wagner, a former member of Nevadas PUC. The energy market in the west is great right now, so they are seeking to curb costs by getting in that market.Cheap natural gas is probably driving the initiative more than anything else, Wagner says. But according to Ellard, the antipathy casinos have for NV Energys monopoly also previews the next phase in an energy economy where renewables are competitive with fossil fuel prices.Its complex because its not just electricity, he said. Its natural gas, wind, coal, smart grid, big data, oil  its all connected. Were at this next change point where wind and solar [battery] storage and smart software are going to start to replace all those energy sources.Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Mandalay Bay convention center will become the biggest rooftop solar array in the US. Photograph: MGM ResortsIf the resorts do decide to separate from NV Energy, it will still cost them a combined $126.5m, a price set by the PUC which they say is necessary to prevent broad consumer rate hikes and to compensate the utility provider for losses incurred on power plants and other assets purchased with casino demand in mind.The resorts have complained that this exit fee is too high  and perhaps even illegal. The PUC has simply made up rules as it goes along so as to discourage any applicants from exiting [NV Energys] service, Wynn lawyers stated in a January judicial appeal. (MGM and the Las Vegas Sands are considering their options.)Wynns president, Matthew Maddox, also noted in PUC testimony that NV Energy is owned by Warren Buffetts company, Berkshire Hathaway (based in Omaha, Nebraska), and is therefore, in his estimation, more concerned with maximizing profits than with maintaining Nevadas grid. Maddox pointed out that their money doesnt even stay in Nevada, saying: it goes to Omaha.Nevadans are subsidizing NV Energys green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installationsData storage company Switch faced a similar situation last year when it announced plans to use 100% renewable energy to power its giant computer servers. NV Energy was not able to meet those energy demands, and the PUC said the company would have to pay $27m to break up with the utility provider since its large data centers amounted to nearly 3% of NV Energys electricity sales. As a compromise, Switch is paying the utility company to build a new solar array in North Las Vegas to meet their sustainability goals.The city of Las Vegas, too, is planning to use 100% renewable energy to power its municipal buildings, fire stations, city parks and streetlights by 2017. That would make Las Vegas the largest US city to achieve such a goal. But to get PUC approval, it also had to promise to buy most of the power from an NV Energy solar plant in nearby Boulder City. Nevadans are thus subsidizing NV Energys green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installations by their customers.MGM Resortss sustainability chief, Ortega, would not comment on her companys wrangling with NV Energy and the PUC. But she did endorse the broad push toward sustainability as a way to combat notions that Sin City lacks a conscience. The more we can dispel the myths around Las Vegas the better destination it is, Ortega said.We have the ability to educate a wide variety of stakeholders on how we can exponentially reduce environmental impacts, she added. Las Vegas is the perfect place to do that because we have 40 million people come here every single year, and so what better place to start telling that story.",Las Vegas casinos seek to power their bright lights with renewable energy,2003-07-16,Dan Hernandez,right,context,context,,219,

George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti-abortion legislation.Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549, also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017. The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect.Discussing the legislation before Tuesdays vote, Faught, the bills author, said when it comes to abortion, people are being allowed to play God.While discussing Faughts legislation on the House floor Rep. Regina Goodwin asked:At what point did you decide that thats within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma?Faught replied:One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life, and I believe life begins at conception.At one point Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Faught if rape is the will of God.Faught responded:Well, you know, if you read the Bible, theres actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but its a reality unfortunately.Williams followed up, asking if incest is the will of God.Faught said:Same answer. Doesnt deal with this bill.Williams continued, asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti-abortion legislation:You wont make any exceptions for rape. You wont make any exceptions for incest, and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you wont do that.Williams Continued:I think it is very important (to know), do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God?After a brief pause, Faught replied:You know its a great question to ask. And obviously if it happens in someones life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but  so youre saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someones life and cant use anything and everything in someones life and I disagree with that.Bottom line: For Rep. Faught, God is sovereign, and everything that happens is part of Gods plan  even rape and incest. Sounds like Faughts God is a moral monster.

This most famous American businessman had played the role of provocateur so often that pundits, reporters, and voters struggled to believe that he was a serious contender. Trump stirred so much controversy that his candidacy puzzled anyone who applied ordinary political logic to the race. But as Michael D'Antonio shows in Never Enough, Trump has rarely been ordinary in his pursuit of success and his trademark method is based on a logic that begins with his firm belief that he is a singular and superior human being.As revealed in this landmark biography, Donald Trump is a man whose appetite for wealth, attention, power, and conquest is practically insatiable. Declaring that he is still the person he was as a rascally little boy, Trump confesses that he avoids reflecting on himself ""because I might not like what I see"" and he believes ""most people aren't worthy of respect.""A product of the media age and the Me Generation that emerged in the 1970s, Trump was a Broadway showman before he became a developer. Mentored by the scoundrel attorney Roy Cohn, Trump was a regular on the New York club scene and won press attention as a dashing young mogul before he had built his first major project. He leveraged his father's enormous fortune and political connections to get his business off the ground, and soon developed a larger-than-life persona. In time, and through many setbacks, he made himself into a living symbol of extravagance and achievement.Drawing upon extensive and exclusive interviews with Trump and many of his family members, including all his adult children, D'Antonio presents the full story of a truly American icon, from his beginnings as a businessman to his stormy romantic life and his pursuit of power in its many forms.

He was the son of Dr. August Heisenberg and his wife Annie Wecklein. His father later became Professor of the Middle and Modern Greek languages in the University of Munich. It was probably due to his influence that Heisenberg remarked, when the Japanese physicist Yukawa discovered the particle now known as the meson and the term ""mesotron"" was proposed for it, that the Greek word ""mesos"" has no ""tr"" in it, with the result that the name ""mesotron"" was changed to ""meson"".Heisenberg went to the Maximilian school at Munich until 1920, when he went to the University of Munich to study physics under Sommerfeld, Wien, Pringsheim, and Rosenthal. During the winter of 1922-1923 he went to Gttingen to study physics under Max Born, Franck, and Hilbert. In 1923 he took his Ph.D. at the University of Munich and then became Assistant to Max Born at the University of Gttingen, and in 1924 he gained the venia legendi at that University.From 1924 until 1925 he worked, with a Rockefeller Grant, with Niels Bohr, at the University of Copenhagen, returning for the summer of 1925 to Gttingen.In 1926 he was appointed Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen under Niels Bohr and in 1927, when he was only 26, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Leipzig.In 1929 he went on a lecture tour to the United States, Japan, and India.In 1941 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Berlin and Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics there.At the end of the Second World War he, and other German physicists, were taken prisoner by American troops and sent to England, but in 1946 he returned to Germany and reorganized, with his colleagues, the Institute for Physics at Gttingen. This Institute was, in 1948, renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics.In 1948 Heisenberg stayed for some months in Cambridge, England, to give lectures, and in 1950 and 1954 he was invited to lecture in the United States. In the winter of 1955-1956 he gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, these lectures being subsequently published as a book.During 1955 Heisenberg was occupied with preparations for the removal of the Max Planck Institute for Physics to Munich. Still Director of this Institute, he went with it to Munich and in 1958 he was appointed Professor of Physics in the University of Munich. His Institute was then being renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics.Heisenberg's name will always be associated with his theory of quantum mechanics, published in 1925, when he was only 23 years old. For this theory and the applications of it which resulted especially in the discovery of allotropic forms of hydrogen, Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for 1932.His new theory was based only on what can be observed, that is to say, on the radiation emitted by the atom. We cannot, he said, always assign to an electron a position in space at a given time, nor follow it in its orbit, so that we cannot assume that the planetary orbits postulated by Niels Bohr actually exist. Mechanical quantities, such as position, velocity, etc. should be represented, not by ordinary numbers, but by abstract mathematical structures called ""matrices"" and he formulated his new theory in terms of matrix equations.Later Heisenberg stated his famous principle of uncertainty, which lays it down that the determination of the position and momentum of a mobile particle necessarily contains errors the product of which cannot be less than the quantum constant h and that, although these errors are negligible on the human scale, they cannot be ignored in studies of the atom.From 1957 onwards Heisenberg was interested in work on problems of plasma physics and thermonuclear processes, and also much work in close collaboration with the International Institute of Atomic Physics at Geneva. He was for several years Chairman of the Scientific Policy Committee of this Institute and subsequently remained a member of this Committee.When he became, in 1953, President of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, he did much to further the policy of this Foundation, which was to invite scientists from other countries to Germany and to help them to work there.Since 1953 his own theoretical work was concentrated on the unified field theory of elementary particles which seems to him to be the key to an understanding of the physics of elementary particles.Apart from many medals and prizes, Heisenberg received an honorary doctorate of the University of Bruxelles, of the Technological University Karlsruhe, and recently (1964) of the University of Budapest; he is also recipient of the Order of Merit of Bavaria, and the Grand Cross for Federal Services with Star (Germany). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and a Knight of the Order of Merit (Peace Class). He is a member of the Academies of Sciences of Gttingen, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, Sweden, Rumania, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Rome (Pontificial), the German Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina (Halle), the Accademia dei Lincei (Rome), and the American Academy of Sciences. During 1949-1951 he was President of the Deutsche Forschungsrat (German Research Council) and in 1953 he became President of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.One of his hobbies is classical music: he is a distinguished pianist. In 1937 Heisenberg married Elisabeth Schumacher. They have seven children, and live in Munich.From Nobel Lectures, Physics 1922-1941, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1965This autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and first published in the book series Les Prix Nobel.

We have plenty of space in our country, but insufficient resources to support everyone who wants to come here. When we see innocent children used as political pawns, it still tugs at our heartstrings, which is the desired intent. The real question is: What are we going to do about it? Immigration reform has been a very tough issue, as well as a political football, and it has produced governmental stalemates and no useful solutions for decades.President Obamas decision to act unilaterally outside of Congress is not the answer. Instead, Congress must use its lawmaking powers to fix a system that is so broken that only a legislative solution can fix it. The lack of policy progress has been incredibly frustrating, and the humanitarian border crisis this summer only highlighted how badly we need a system that deals efficiently and effectively with both illegal and legal immigration.It is time for Congress to act and to do so in a bipartisan fashion that engenders the confidence of the American people. There are many common-sense prescriptions within reach of our government. It is time to seize them.To begin to solve this problem, we must first have some understanding of why it exists. Despite all of its problems, America is still the place of dreams. As such, it is small wonder that so many from other nations would like to live here.Right now, we have very porous borders and unenthusiastic and inconsistent enforcement of immigration laws. Further incentives for illegal immigration are easy enrollment in public schools, easy employment for those willing to take jobs others dont want, easy access to health care and easy acquisition of public support through welfare programs. Yet this population cannot participate in the formal workforce, which means they cannot contribute fully to their local economies.Any discussion of immigration reform should include bipartisan solutions that both address the undocumented population here today and discourage illegal immigration going forward. If these issues are not addressed, solutions will fall short. On the other hand, if all of these issues are addressed firmly and consistently, we can uphold the rule of law and discourage further illegal immigration. Detractors will say that if it were that simple, it already would have been done and we wouldnt be having this discussion. What they fail to account for is the fact that the issues have not been addressed.A national guest-worker program makes sense and seems to work well in Canada. Non-citizens would have to apply for a guest-worker permit and have a guaranteed job awaiting them. Taxes would be paid at a rate commensurate with other U.S. workers, and special visas would allow for easy entry and egress across borders. Guest-worker status would be granted to individuals and not to groups.People already here illegally could apply for guest-worker status from outside of the country. This means they would have to leave first. They should in no way be rewarded for having broken our laws, but if they are wise, they will arrange with their employer before they leave to immediately offer them a legal job as soon as their application is received. When they return, they still would not be U.S. citizens, but they would be legal, and they would be paying taxes. Only jobs that are vacant as a result of a lack of interest by American citizens should be eligible for the guest-worker program.In return for greater certainty on immigration, employers must bear some responsibility for making sure that no illegal immigrants are hired. Employers who break the rules should receive swift, severe and consistent punishment that constitutes a real deterrent and not a mere inconvenience. A second infraction should be a criminal offense and treated as such.All of this is irrelevant unless we have secure borders. There is much that can be learned from security personnel in prisons and other secured facilities, and there is a great deal of smart technology that can be employed to achieve secure borders. It is a matter of will rather than ability.As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: We must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rule of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society. Lets solve the problem and stop playing political football.Receive Ben Carson commentaries in your email BONUS: By signing up for Ben Carson alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email.

The House had passed the measure earlier this year. The White House has signaled Trump will sign the legislation.The Obama rule would have prevented an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm. It was crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system in the wake of the 2012 massacre of 20 young students and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old man with a variety of impairments, including Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, shot and killed his mother at their home, then went to school where he killed the students, adults and himself. He used his mother's guns in the attack.The Obama administration rule required the Social Security Administration to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party manage their benefits.But lawmakers, with the backing of the National Rifle Association and advocacy groups for the disabled, opposed the regulation and encouraged Congress to undertake a rarely successful parliamentary tool designed to void regulations that Congress takes issue with.With a Republican ally in the White House, the GOP has moved aggressively on several fronts to rescind some of the Obama administration's final regulations on the environment, financial reporting and now guns. Under an expedited process established through the Congressional Review Act, a regulation is made invalid when a simple majority of both chambers pass a joint resolution of disapproval and the president signs it.The House also voted to repeal three Labor Department regulations Wednesday, including a rule that established when states could require drug testing for certain laid-off workers seeking unemployment insurance. Critics seeking the repeal said the department crafted the regulation so narrowly that it undermined congressional intent to give states more leeway to use drug testing in their unemployment insurance programs.On the gun rule, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, spearheaded the repeal effort, saying the regulation unfairly stigmatizes the disabled and infringes on their constitutional right to bear arms. He said that the mental disorders covered through the regulation are filled with ""vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard"" prohibiting someone from buying or owning a gun.Grassley cited eating and sleep disorders as examples of illnesses that could allow a beneficiary to be reported to the background check system if they also have a third party to manage their benefits.Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he didn't know how he could explain to his constituents, including those in Newtown, that Congress was making it easier rather than harder for people with serious mental illness to have a gun.""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm,"" Murphy said.Gun rights groups weren't the only organizations upset about the Obama administration's regulation. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized it, too. The ACLU said the rule advanced a harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, ""a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent."" More than a dozen advocacy groups for the disabled also opposed the Obama administration's regulation.""This heartless resolution puts the most vulnerable Americans at risk,"" countered Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Make no mistake, this vote was really about deepening the gun industry's customer pool, at the expense of those in danger of hurting themselves or others.""On the labor rule, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Texas are among the states seeking more flexibility in using drug tests in their unemployment insurance programs. Republicans complained that the Obama administration regulation undercut that flexibility  and congressional intent.""I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that,"" said Rep.

Foster Jr. | 22 March 2017Addicting InfoWomen should get as far away from Oklahoma as soon as possible because Christian Sharia law is about to make their lives a living hell.If Oklahoma state GOP Rep. George Faught has his way, rape will be on the path to being legal in the state. At least thats what rapists are hoping for after Faught made a frightening statement on the subject during a debate on House Bill 1549, which restricts abortion.Democratic Rep. Cory Williams masterfully cornered Faught during the hearing by asking him if he believes rape and incest are the will of God since the legislation has no exceptions for either, meaning women would be forced to give birth to their rapists baby.Faughts reply is absolutely appalling and demonstrates once again why women should never vote for Republicans, especially Republicans who want to base our laws on the Bible.Well, you know, if you read the Bible, theres actually a couple circumstances where that happened, Faught said. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but its a reality unfortunately.Faught literally just used the Bible to justify rape. And then he used it to justify incest.Same answer, Faught replied. Then he argued that Williams questions have nothing to do with the bill. Williams vehemently disagreed and explained why.You are proffering a divine intervention as the reason why you wont do that and so I think it is very important, Williams said before demanding Faught repeat his answer again. This body wants to know  and myself personally  whether you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God.Faught obliged and stated that rape and incest are Gods will because God is sovereign over all activities that happen.Its a great question to ask. And, obviously if it happens in someones life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but  so youre saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someones life and cant use anything and everything in someones life and I disagree with that.Seriously.Heres the video via YouTube.This is exactly the same kind of statement that Republicans like Rick Santorum and Richard Mourdock made during the 2012 Election.I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created  in the sense of rape  but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you, Santorum said during his run for the presidency. As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I cant think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation.Ive struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God, Mourdock said during his Senate run in Indiana. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.Both of these guys think that rape is sanctioned by God and that women should appreciate the gift God is giving them by force. Its disgusting and is the reason why both men lost their races.And now Faught should be ousted from office as well.Be sure to like us on Facebook",Oklahoma Republican Declares That Rape Is The Will Of God,4/24/17,,right,right,n,,231,

What Ellison and his Muslim and leftist supporters are saying is that it is of no consequence what America holds as its holiest book; all that matters is what any individual holds to be his holiest book.Forgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison's favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath.Devotees of multiculturalism and political correctness who do not see how damaging to the fabric of American civilization it is to allow Ellison to choose his own book need only imagine a racist elected to Congress. Would they allow him to choose Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" the Nazis' bible, for his oath? And if not, why not? On what grounds will those defending Ellison's right to choose his favorite book deny that same right to a racist who is elected to public office?So why are we allowing Keith Ellison to do what no other member of Congress has ever done -- choose his own most revered book for his oath?The answer is obvious -- Ellison is a Muslim. And whoever decides these matters, not to mention virtually every editorial page in America, is not going to offend a Muslim. In fact, many of these people argue it will be a good thing because Muslims around the world will see what an open society America is and how much Americans honor Muslims and the Koran.But these naive people do not appreciate that America will not change the attitude of a single American-hating Muslim by allowing Ellison to substitute the Koran for the Bible. In fact, the opposite is more likely: Ellison's doing so will embolden Islamic extremists and make new ones, as Islamists, rightly or wrongly, see the first sign of the realization of their greatest goal -- the Islamicization of America.When all elected officials take their oaths of office with their hands on the very same book, they all affirm that some unifying value system underlies American civilization. If Keith Ellison is allowed to change that, he will be doing more damage to the unity of America and to the value system that has formed this country than the terrorists of 9-11. It is hard to believe that this is the legacy most Muslim Americans want to bequeath to America. But if it is, it is not only Europe that is in trouble.","America, Not Keith Ellison, decides what book a congressman takes his oath on",11/28/06,Dennis Prager,right,context,context,,236,

In other words  it doesnt change his regular joe status.But the thing is, Nye is no regular joe.Also Read: Bill Nye Set to Debunk Tony Robbins-Style Hot Coal Walking With Hard ScienceNye is the only entertainment personality with the movements distinction, although he also holds a degree in mechanical engineering.

(The March for Science is a reaction from the scientific community over the Trump administrations handling of science issues, especially when it comes to climate change.)Bill is arguably best known for hosting the popular childrens show Bill Nye the Science Guy in the mid-1990s, but his history since then has made him a headliner in the climate change conversation. He has been a part of a few tense debates concerning the realities of climate change, and hes only going to talk about it more on his new show, much to the chagrin of people who may not want to hear it.Im trying to change the world, he told TheWrap in a recent interview. You may be tired of people like me talking about climate change. Were tired, too! he said. Its the most important problem facing humankind, in my opinion.Also Read: Bill Nye's Netflix Talk Show Gets First Trailer Featuring Zach Braff, Rachel Bloom, Wil Wheaton (Video)Nye has grown far beyond the confines of his childrens show host persona. He still wears the bowties and puts on a cheery, enthusiastic exterior (he uses phrases like sunshine team in our interview), but like a lot of his original audience, his priorities lie in different areas, specifically in debunking pseudo-science. Hes taken on climate change deniers on talk shows and has been vocal in the fight for legitimizing science. This has made him some enemies, such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who he says is probably anti-Bill.Bill Nye Saves the World seeks to help its audience tackle scientific issues with a critical eye. With the help of guest stars such as Zach Braff, Karlie Kloss, Tim Gunn and others, Nye and his correspondents, as he calls them, go around the world exploring topics such as alternative medicine and climate change  things that have scores of believers but no basis in science.In one episode, Nye and his team address the spiritual practice of walking on burning hot coals. While people pay for retreats to learn how to do this, Nye proves that its possible mostly with physics.People will charge you $5,000 for a weekend where you learn to be spiritually prepared to walk across wooden burning coals. You dont have to do that, you can just walk across wooden burning coals, he exclaimed.Also Read: Sarah Palin Doesn't Think Bill Nye the Science Guy Is a Real ScientistIn another, he highlights alternative medicine practices, seeking to educate people on the realities of the industry in a literal sense. These methods of healing may have mental effects but for Nye, theres no basis in science.If you go to a foo-foo grocery store where the food is whole, for example, most of their money is made off these alternative medicines or dietary supplements, and most of them dont do anything, he said. I think people will be interested to watch it.While hes interested in how things look now, hes also looking to the future. In the interview, he mentions his fascination with self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, predicting that by April 2034, driving a car will be a skill like horseback riding: only a select number of people will know how to do it.My grandfather apparently rode horses to run into World War I, Nye said. Now, nobody rides horses. Everything changed in just 20 years.Through his work both on the show and off, Nye seeks to teach people how to think critically. He realizes that people have a cognitive dissonance in regards to certain issues like climate change  understandable to him considering how isolated certain parts of the United States are and how belief systems work, he says  but he hopes that people can learn to use reason.Also Read: 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' Creator (Partly) Credits Online Piracy for Show's Revival[The audience believes] they can influence the future and leave the world better than when they found it.

At the same time, we are moving forward to take important, unprecedented action on asbestos.The problem formulation documents refine the scope of risk evaluations for the first ten chemicals selected under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The Agencys problem formulation documents are an important interim step prior to completing and publishing the final risk evaluations by December 2019. They clarify the chemical uses that EPA expects to evaluate and describe how EPA expects to conduct the evaluations. Read the documents. Comments are due in 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register.EPAs systematic review approach document will guide EPAs selection and review of studies in addition to providing the public with continued transparency regarding how the Agency plans to evaluate scientific information. Read the document. Comments are due in 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register (Docket: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0210).For asbestos, EPA is proposing a SNUR for certain uses of asbestos (including asbestos-containing goods) that would require manufacturers and importers to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos. This review process would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of asbestos and, when necessary, take action to prohibit or limit the use. Read the document.

The miracle is to walk on the green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive. - Thich Nhat HanhOne of the most magnificent geologic features in the world is the Ausangate Mountain of the Peruvian Andes. The mountain is striped with colors ranging from turquoise to lavender to maroon and gold. However, this ""painted mountain"" is notoriously difficult to find and get to, requiring several days of hiking to reach its peak deep within the Andes by way of Cusco.The painted Ausangate mountain is also considered to be holy and believed to be the deity of Cusco by local Peruvians. It is a site of daily worship and offerings by local citizens. Every year thousands of Quechua pilgrims visit the Ausangate Mountain for the Star Snow festival which takes place a week before the Corpus Christi feast.The mountain sits at an elevation of 6,384 meters and is located approximately 100 km southeast of the major city Cusco. The local area is rich in geology, from uplifted granitic cliffs to glaciers which have eroded large valleys and the cretaceous limestone ""forest"" nearby.The Andes are an incredibly complex mountain chain that extends along the western edge of the South American continent. The subduction of the Nazca plate underneath the South American plate initiated mountain building and uplift of the mountain range. This produced significant volcanism and the introduction of rare and varied mineralogy to the Andes Mountains.The reason we see the rainbow coloration in the stratigraphic layers of the Ausangate mountain is largely due to weathering and mineralogy. Red coloration of sedimentary layers often indicates iron oxide rust as a trace mineral. Similar to how a nail will rust and turn red when oxidized, sediments that are iron rich will change when exposed to oxygen and water. This, in combination with uplift and tectonically driven crustal shortening has tilted the sedimentary layers on their side exposing stripped stratigraphic intervals.The different coloration is due to different environmental conditions and mineralogy when the sediment was originally deposited and subsequently diagenetically altered. Introduction of goethite or oxidized limonite will introduce a brownish coloration to sandstones. The bright yellow coloration could be due to iron sulphide as trace minerals within the pore cement. In addition, chlorite will often color sediments varying shades of green dependent on diagenetic history and concentration.As your eye scans the many layers of the Peruvian Painted Mountain you're seeing millions of years of history and all the complexities that are associated therein. Understanding the environmental and geologic conditions that formed the rock units we see today is one of the key building blocks of geology and allow us to better understand our world long before humans walked this green Earth.",Welcome To The Incredible Rainbow Mountains Of Peru,1/21/17,Trevor Nace,right,context,right,photo,241,

Amazon recently pulled a number of high-profile hoverboard brands from its online store following reports of the electric scooters bursting into flames. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) is looking into at least 10 reports of the devices overheating and causing fires, according to numerous reports like this one from NBC News.The USCPSC isnt naming names, so its unclear which brands are to blame for the issue. The general belief is that cheaper models, especially no-name brands from China, are the problem. Bigger (and more expensive) names may be a safer bet.Amazon isnt taking any chances, however, and is only selling a select number of hoverboards at this writing, including brands such as Hover X, Jetson, and Sharper Image. The rest are being asked to provide documentation proving their products comply with various safety standards for batteries and chargers, hoverboard maker Swagway recently told The Verge.Airlines are also getting into the anti-hoverboard action. Alaskan, American, British Airways, Delta, Hawaiian, Jet Blue, Spirit, United, and Virgin America are all forbidding hoverboards on their aircraft. The ban includes carry-on and checked luggage. A family in Louisiana also blamed a house fire on a new hoverboard.Delta recently said in a statement it believes the lithium-ion batteries powering the hoveboards are to blame. The airline said manufacturers are inconsistent when it comes to proper labeling for the size and power of the batteries. Delta also said many hoverboards have batteries that exceed the 160 watt hour size, which is the maximum allowed onboard a plane.The impact on you at home: If you were thinking about snagging a hoverboard as a gift this season it might be wise to make other plans. Product review sites like Best Reviews and the Wirecutter are advising people not to buy these devices until the safety concerns are cleared up.

""You guys are misunderstanding again. Thats not how it is.""However, after speaking to her daughters teacher, she realized the statement was accurate.The teacher said she cant. She has to say yes.

""We want to promote kindness, and so we want you to say yes when someone asks you to dance.""I do see it from their perspective when it comes to that, but there are many other ways to teach children how to be accepting than with a social dance, Richard counters.Richard says forcing students not to say no teaches them the wrong lesson.Sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say 'yes'; sends a bad message to boys that girls cant say 'no,'"" Richard said.Prior to the dance, which is voluntary, students are told to fill out a card by selecting five people they want to dance with. The administration says if theres someone on the card you feel uncomfortable with, the student is encouraged to speak up.If there is an issue, if theres students that are uncomfortable or have a problem with another student, I mean: thats certainly something that can be addressed with that student and parents, Findlay said.However, Richard says rejection is part of life and at the end of the day, this policy is sending impressionable children the wrong message.Psychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I cant say 'no' to a boy,"" she said. ""Thats the message kids are getting.""One of the concerns that Richard addressed with the principal at Kanesville Elementary is that parents werent aware of this policy.

He reported for a Chicago-area daily newspaper and was senior news writer for Christianity Today magazine and an editor for Worldwide Newsroom before joining WND shortly after 9/11. He earned a master's degree in communications from Wheaton College.ADVERTISEMENTParents of students at a Catholic school in the San Francisco Bay area are protesting the boards decision to remove and relocate more than 160 statues of Jesus, Mary and historic church figures from the campus in an effort to make the school more inclusive.Shannon Fitzpatrick, who has an 8-year-old son at San Domenico School in San Anselmo told the local Marin Independent Journal that articulating an inclusive foundation appears to mean letting go of San Domenicos 167-year tradition as a Dominican Catholic school and being both afraid and ashamed to celebrate ones heritage and beliefs.She said that during the time of her familys association with the K-12 independent school, the word Catholic has been removed from the mission statement, sacraments were removed from the curriculum, the lower school curriculum was changed to world religions, the logo and colors were changed to be less Catholic, and the uniform was changed to be less Catholic.The chair of the schools board of trustees, Amy Skewes-Cox, explained to the local paper that the move was made to help non-Christian students feel more welcome.If you walk on the campus and the first thing you confront is three or four statues of St. Dominic or St. Francis, it could be alienating for that other religion, and we didnt want to further that feeling, she said.The removal of a statue of Mary and the Christ child from the schools center courtyard was especially troubling to parents.Fitzpatrick said other families share her concern.Many parents feel if the school is heading in a different direction then the San Domenico community should have been notified before the signing of the enrollment for the following year, she said.Another parent, Cheryl Newell, told the Independent Journal the school is trying to be something for everyone, and theyre making no one happy.Skewes-Cox told the Marin County paper the relocation and removal of some of the schools 180 religious statues was completely in compliance with a new strategic plan approved unanimously last year by the board and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael.She said at least 18 remain, including a statue of St. Dominic at the center of the campus.The trustees director insisted that while the removal coincides with the removal of Confederate statues across the United States, the issues are totally different and have absolutely no connection other than it is change, and people have a hard time with change.In 2006, WND reported a cross in the chapel at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, was removed to make the chapel a faith-specific space, and to make it more welcoming to students, faculty, staff and visitors of all faiths.San Domenico, founded by the Dominican Sisters in 1850 as an independent, Catholic school, meaning its not owned by a religious order, has 660 students, including 98 from foreign nations. Among the religions they represent are Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.Instead of teaching Catholic theology, the school provides instruction in world religions and philosophy.The head of the school, Cecily Stock, told the Independent Journal the schools approach is really about empowering each student and giving them the information so they can discover their own purpose, their own truth.Mirza Khan, the schools director of philosophy, ethics and world religions, told the paper the Dominican teaching philosophy is not to teach there is only one truth.It is to foster conversation, to intentionally invite in participants that have different perspectives in a very open-ended process of philosophical and spiritual inquiry. That has been a long-standing part of the Dominican tradition.",Catholic school removes Jesus statues to be 'more inclusive',8/29/17,,right,context,right,,250,

At right, from top, Wendy Miller around age 16, Debbie Wesson Gibson around age 17 and Gloria Thacker Deason around age 18. (Family photos)Leigh Corfman says she was 14 years old when an older man approached her outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Ala. She was sitting on a wooden bench with her mother, they both recall, when the man introduced himself as Roy Moore.It was early 1979 and Moore  now the Republican nominee in Alabama for a U.S. Senate seat  was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. He struck up a conversation, Corfman and her mother say, and offered to watch the girl while her mother went inside for a child custody hearing.He said, Oh, you dont want her to go in there and hear all that. Ill stay out here with her,  says Corfmans mother, Nancy Wells, 71. I thought, how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl.This undated family photo shows Leigh Corfman with her mother, Nancy Wells, around 1979 when Corfman was about 14 years old. (Family Photo)Alone with Corfman, Moore chatted with her and asked for her phone number, she says. Days later, she says, he picked her up around the corner from her house in Gadsden, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, told her how pretty she was and kissed her. On a second visit, she says, he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. He touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.I wanted it over with  I wanted out, she remembers thinking. Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over. Corfman says she asked Moore to take her home, and he did.Two of Corfmans childhood friends say she told them at the time that she was seeing an older man, and one says Corfman identified the man as Moore. Wells says her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later, as Moore was becoming more prominent as a local judge.Aside from Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Washington Post in recent weeks say Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they say they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older. None of the three women say that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.Wendy Miller says she was 14 and working as a Santas helper at the Gadsden Mall when Moore first approached her, and 16 when he asked her on dates, which her mother forbade. Debbie Wesson Gibson says she was 17 when Moore spoke to her high school civics class and asked her out on the first of several dates that did not progress beyond kissing. Gloria Thacker Deason says she was an 18-year-old cheerleader when Moore began taking her on dates that included bottles of Mateus Ros wine. The legal drinking age in Alabama was 19.Of the four women, the youngest at the time was Corfman, who is the only one who says she had sexual contact with Moore that went beyond kissing. She says they did not have intercourse.In a written statement, Moore denied the allegations.These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign, Moore, now 70, said.The campaign said in a subsequent statement that if the allegations were true they would have surfaced during his previous campaigns, adding this garbage is the very definition of fake news.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP senators on Nov. 9 called on Roy Moore to withdraw from a Senate race in Alabama if allegations of sexual misconduct are true. (The Washington Post)After The Post published this story Thursday afternoon, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and a handful of other GOP senators said Moore must step aside if Corfmans account is true.According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moores Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary, including Sen. Luther Strange, whom he defeated this fall in a runoff election.Corfman, 53, who works as a customer service representative at a payday loan business, says she has voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016. She says she thought of confronting Moore personally for years, and almost came forward publicly during his first campaign for state Supreme Court in 2000, but decided against it. Her two children were still in school then and she worried about how it would affect them. She also was concerned that her background  three divorces and a messy financial history  might undermine her credibility.There is no one here that doesnt know that Im not an angel, Corfman says, referring to her home town of Gadsden.Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post. The Post confirmed that her mother attended a hearing at the courthouse in February 1979 through divorce records. Moores office was down the hall from the courtroom.Neither Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post. While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moores Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore. The women say they dont know one another.I have prayed over this, Corfman says, explaining why she decided to tell her story now. All I know is that I cant sit back and let this continue, let him continue without the mask being removed.This account is based on interviews with more than 30 people who said they knew Moore between 1977 and 1982, when he served as an assistant district attorney for Etowah County in northern Alabama, where he grew up.****Moore was 30 and single when he joined the district attorneys office, his first government job after attending the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, serving in Vietnam, graduating from law school and working briefly as a lawyer in private practice in Gadsden, the county seat.By his account, chronicled in his book So Help Me God, Moore spent his time as a prosecutor convicting murderers, rapists, thieves and drug pushers. He writes that it was around this time that I fashioned a plaque of The Ten Commandments on two redwood tablets.I believed that many of the young criminals whom I had to prosecute would not have committed criminal acts if they had been taught these rules as children, Moore writes.Outside work, Moore writes that he spent his free time building rooms onto a mobile home in Gallant, a rural area about 25 miles west of Gadsden.According to colleagues and others who knew him at the time, Moore was rarely seen socializing outside work. He spent one season coaching the Gallant Girls, a softball team that his teenage sister had joined, said several women who played on the team. He spent time working out at the Gadsden YMCA, according to people who encountered him there. And he often walked, usually alone, around the newly opened Gadsden Mall  6 feet tall and well-dressed in slacks and a button-down shirt, say several women who worked there at the time.Corfman describes herself as a little lost  a typical 14-year-old kid of a divorced family  when she says she first met Moore that day in 1979 outside the courtroom. She says she felt flattered that a grown man was paying attention to her.He was charming and smiley, she says.After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house.I was kind of giddy, excited, you know? An older guy, you know? Corfman says, adding that her only sexual experience at that point had been kissing boys her age.She says that it was dark and cold when he picked her up, and that she thought they were going out to eat. Instead, she says, he drove her to his house, which seemed far, far away.I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got, Corfman says.She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did.Soon after, she says, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot.This was a new experience, and it was exciting and fun and scary, Corfman says, explaining why she went back. It was just like this roller-coaster ride youve not been on.She says that Moore drove her back to the same house after dark, and that before long she was lying on a blanket on the floor. She remembers Moore disappearing into another room and coming out with nothing on but tight white underwear.She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.I wasnt ready for that  I had never put my hand on a mans penis, much less an erect one, Corfman says.She remembers thinking, I dont want to do this and I need to get out of here. She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did.The legal age of consent in Alabama, then and now, is 16. Under Alabama law in 1979, and today, a person who is at least 19 years old who has sexual contact with someone older than 12 and younger than 15 has committed sexual abuse in the second degree. Sexual contact is defined as touching of sexual or intimate parts. The crime is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail.The law then and now also includes a section on enticing a child younger than 16 to enter a home with the purpose of proposing sexual intercourse or fondling of sexual and genital parts. That is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.In Alabama, the statute of limitations for bringing felony charges involving sexual abuse of a minor in 1979 would have run out three years later, and the time frame for filing a civil complaint would have ended when the alleged victim turned 21, according to Child USA, a nonprofit research and advocacy group at the University of Pennsylvania.Corfman never filed a police report or a civil suit.She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.Betsy Davis, who remains friendly with Corfman and now lives in Los Angeles, says she clearly remembers Corfman talking about seeing an older man named Roy Moore when they were teenagers. She says Corfman described an encounter in which the older man wore nothing but tight white underwear. She says she was firm with Corfman that seeing someone as old as Moore was out of bounds.I remember talking to her and telling her its not a good idea, Davis says. Because we were so young.A second friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job, has a similar memory of a teenage Corfman telling her about seeing an older man.After talking to her friends, Corfman says, she began to feel that she had done something wrong and kept it a secret for years.I felt responsible, she says. I felt like I had done something bad. And it kind of set the course for me doing other things that were bad.She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16.As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records.In 2005, Corfman paid a fine for driving a boat without lights. In 2010, she was working at a convenience store when she was charged with a misdemeanor for selling beer to a minor. The charge was dismissed, court records show.****This undated photo shows Gloria Thacker Deason when she was about 18. (Family photo)The three other women who spoke to The Post say that Moore asked them on dates when they were between 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s.Gloria Thacker Deason says she was 18 and Moore was 32 when they met in 1979 at the Gadsden Mall, where she worked at the jewelry counter of a department store called Pizitz. She says she was attending Gadsden State Community College and still living at home.My mom was really, really strict and my curfew was 10:30 but she would let me stay out later with Roy, says Deason, who is now 57 and lives in North Carolina. She just felt like I would be safe with him. . . . She thought he was good husband material.Deason says that they dated off and on for several months and that he took her to his house at least two times. She says their physical relationship did not go further than kissing and hugging.He liked Eddie Rabbitt and I liked Freddie Mercury, Deason says, referring to the country singer and the British rocker.She says that Moore would pick her up for dates at the mall or at college basketball games, where she was a cheerleader. She remembers changing out of her uniform before they went out for dinners at a pizzeria called Maters, where she says Moore would order bottles of Mateus Ros, or at a Chinese restaurant, where she says he would order her tropical cocktails at a time when she believes she was younger than 19, the legal drinking age.If Mother had known that, she would have had a hissy fit, says Deason, who says she turned 19 in May 1979, after she and Moore started dating.This undated family photo shows Wendy Miller around the time she was 16. (Family photo)Around the same time that Deason says she met Moore at the jewelry counter, Wendy Miller says that Moore approached her at the mall, where she would spend time with her mom, who worked at a photo booth there. Miller says this was in 1979, when she was 16.She says that Moores face was familiar because she had first met him two years before, when she was dressed as an elf and working as a Santas helper at the mall. She says that Moore told her she looked pretty, and that two years later, he began asking her out on dates in the presence of her mother at the photo booth. She says she had a boyfriend at the time, and declined.Her mother, Martha Brackett, says she refused to grant Moore permission to date her 16-year-old daughter.Id say, Youre too old for her . . . lets not rob the cradle,  Brackett recalls telling Moore.Miller, who is now 54 and still lives in Alabama, says she was flattered by the attention.Now that Ive gotten older, she says, the idea that a grown man would want to take out a teenager, thats disgusting to me.This undated family photo shows Debbie Wesson Gibson when she was about 17. (Family photo)Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said Roy Moore, her mother said, Id say you were the luckiest girl in the world.Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore had this godlike, almost deity status  he was a hometown boy made good, Gibson says, West Point and so forth.Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club.Looking back, Im glad nothing bad happened, says Gibson, who now lives in Florida. As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate.****By 1982, Moore was by his own account in his book causing a stir in the district attorneys office for his willingness to criticize the workings of the local legal system. He convened a grand jury to look into what he alleged were funding problems in the sheriffs office. In response, Moore writes, the state bar association investigated him for going against the advice of the district attorney, an inquiry that was dismissed.Soon after, Moore quit and began his first political campaign for the countys circuit court judge position. He lost overwhelmingly, and left Alabama shortly thereafter, heading to Texas, where he says in his book that he trained as a kickboxer, and to Australia, where he says he lived on a ranch for a year wrangling cattle.He returned to Gadsden in 1984 and went into private law practice. In 1985, at age 38, he married Kayla Kisor, who was 24. The two are still married.A few years later, Moore began his rise in Alabama politics and into the national spotlight.In 1992, he became a circuit court judge and hung his wooden Ten Commandments plaque in his courtroom.In 2000, he was elected chief justice of Alabamas Supreme Court, and he soon installed a 5,280-pound granite Ten Commandments monument in the judicial building.In 2003, he was dismissed from the bench for ignoring a federal court order to remove the monument, and became known nationally as The Ten Commandments Judge.Moore was again elected chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2012, and was again dismissed for ignoring a judicial order, this time for instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Roy Moore, a 2018 U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama, shared remarks at the Values Voter Summit on Oct. 13. (C-SPAN)All of this has made Moore a hero to many Alabama voters, who consider him a stalwart Christian willing to stand up for their values. In a September Republican primary for the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Moore defeated the appointed sitting senator, Luther Strange, who was backed by President Trump and other party leaders in Washington. Moore faces the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, in a special election scheduled for Dec. 12.On a visit home in the mid-1990s to see her mother and stepfather in Alabama, Corfman says, she saw Moores photo in the Gadsden Times. Mother, do you remember this guy?  Wells says Corfman said at the time.Thats when Corfman told her, Wells recalls. Her daughter said that not long after the court hearing in 1979, Moore took her to his house. Wells says that her daughter conveyed to her that Moore had behaved inappropriately.I was horrified, Wells says.Years later, Corfman says, she saw a segment about Moore on ABC Newss Good Morning America. She says she threw up.There were times, Corfman says, she thought about confronting Moore. At one point during the late 1990s, she says, she became so angry that she drove to the parking lot outside Moores office at the county courthouse in Gadsden. She sat there for a while, she says, rehearsing what she might say to him. Remember me?  she imagined herself saying.Read more:Roy Moore disrupts Senate race in AlabamaA short history of Roy Moores controversial interpretations of the Bible.Roy Moore tried to fit in with Senate Republicans for a day.","Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32",2011-09-17,Stephanie Mccrummen,context,context,n,,251,

Adult CD1 wild-type mouse first molars were used and damage stimulated by controlling drilling (see below). The drugs of choice and vehicle were based on previous reports in the literature and also translational potential into a simple, cost effective dental therapy.In order to evaluate the reparative capacity of the drugs, six to nine teeth were evaluated per time point and a sample size of 2030 teeth per group was used for the in vivo gene expression assay. The reparative time points used in this study were in accordance with UK Home Office animal regulations. This study was not blind and sample selection was not random.Injury ProtocolAll animals used in this study were handled in accordance to UK Home Office Regulations project license 70/7866 and personal license I6517C8EF. Experimental procedures were approved by the Kings College Ethical Review Process. The mice were anaesthetized with a solution made with Hypnorm (Fentanyl/fluanisone - VetaPharma Ltd.), sterile water and Hypnovel (Midazolam - Roche) in the ratio 1:2:1 at the rate of 10 ml/kg intraperitonially. A rounded carbide burr FG 1/4 coupled to a high speed hand piece was used to access the dentine of the mouse superior molar teeth. Once the burr cut exposed the dentine, a 30G needle was used to penetrate the pulp. In order to protect the pulp from external contamination and stimulate dentine repair, the injury was capped either with ProRoot Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) (Maillfer Dentsply), or Kolspon (Fish Collage Type 1- Eucare Ltd) alone, or in association with 50 nM BIO (SIGMA), 5 M CHIR99021 (SIGMA), or 50 nM Tideglusib (SIGMA) dissolved and diluted in DMSO, in contact with the pulp. A layer of 3 M Ketac-Cem Radiopaque was used as a capping material to seal the injured site. The damage was performed on the two upper first molars. For incisor damage a fine needle was inserted through the mouse lower tooth into the pulp. Post-op the mice were given Vetergesic (Buprenorphine  Ceva) at the rate of 0.3 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection as analgesic. The animals were sacrificed after 1 day, 4 weeks and 6 weeks.Cytotoxity assay17IA4 cells were plated in 96 well plates at 20,000 cells/cm2 and incubated (37 C, 5% CO 2 /95% air, 100% humidity) for 24 hrs using standard culture medium. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with conditioned (drugs + media) and control media (media alone) for another 24 hrs. (10 l of drug in DMSO + 90 l of media resulting on the following concentrations BIO: 200, 100, 50 nM; CHIR99021: 10, 8, 5 M; Tideglusib: 200, 100, 50 nM). To determine the cell metabolic activity, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma) was added to the controls and the conditioned media after 24 hrs. The resulting formazan product was then dissolved in 200 l of dimethyl sulfoxide per well (DMSO, Sigma). A colorimetric plate reader (Thermo Multiskan Ascent 354 microplate reader) was used to read the absorbance at 540 nm with background subtraction at 630 nm.In vitro drug release17IA4 cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated (37 C, 5% CO 2 /95% air, 100% humidity) for 24 h using standard culture medium. FalconTM cell culture inserts for use with 24-well plates (3 m pore size) were placed in the wells carrying 96 mm2 Kolspon cubes either dry or soaked in 30 l of the drug optimal concentration for 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 6, and 12 hours. The cells were collected with TRIzol and stored at 20 C.Pulp collectionP21 mice had their superior first molars drilled according to the drilling protocol. Tooth pulp tissue was collected according to the experiment time course after injury. The superior first molars were extracted using a 21 G needle as an elevator to lift them from the alveolar bone and the extracted molars were kept in ice cold PBS. Using a 23 scalpel blade the molars were separated at the crown-root junction, so that the pulp chamber could be visualized. Using a 0.6 mm straight tip tweezer the pulp was gently scraped from the pulp chamber and the root canal. The pulp was then placed into cold Sigma RNAlater and stored at 80 C.Q-PCRRNA was extracted from the cells in culture with the drugs in after 15, and 30 mins, 1, 6, and 12 hours, and also from the dental pulp collected from CD1 P21 wild-type mice without injury (control) and 1 day after injury using TRIzol. (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was quantified using Nanodrop and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Beta-actin was used as housekeeping gene (Forward- GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG, Reverse- CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCTGT) and Axin2 was the read-out for Wnt pathway activity (Forward-TGACTCTCCTTCCAGATCCCA, Reverse-TGCCCACACTAGGCTGACA).MicroCT/mineral analysisMice upper molars were dissected and fixed with PFA 4% overnight and scanned using a Bruker Skyscan1272 micro-CT scanner. After scanning, Microview software programme (GE) was used for visualization and analysis. Two dimensional (2D) images were obtained from micro-CT cross-sectional images of superior first molar internal part, to evaluate if the drilling was successful and mineral formation. In order to assay tissue mineral content a ROI of X = 0.2 mm, Y = 0.4 mm, and Z = 0.2 mm was set as standard for all the samples and the mineral analysis was performed. The region measured comprised only of the injury site. ROI complete filled with mineral = 0.0017 mg.HistologyAfter 4 weeks decalcification in 19% EDTA the teeth were embedded in wax blocks and sectioned using 8 m thickness.

A few said that a Facebook post claimed that President Barack Obama, Sen. Harry Reid and Democrats in Congress were trying to get themselves exempted from Obamacare, in the words of one reader.But there is no bill in Congress calling for an exemption from the health care law. In fact, members of Congress and their staffs face additional requirements that most Americans dont have to meet.Under the health care law, their insurance coverage will have to switch from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the group of private insurance plans that cover 8 million federal employees and retirees, to the exchanges created by the law. Those exchanges are meant for those who buy coverage on their own, the currently uninsured and small businesses. Members of Congress and their staffs would be the only employees of a large employer in the exchanges, which are set to begin offering insurance in January.So, why is the false exempt claim making the Facebook rounds? There is reportedly concern on Capitol Hill that the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, wont be able to smoothly transition members and their staffs into an exchange. The concern, as a Roll Call story explained, was that the government wouldnt be able to make contributions toward the federal employees premiums, at least at the beginning of 2014. That would mean employees would pick up the whole tab for their insurance policies. Right now, the government pays 72 percent of premiums on average.The exempt claims were sparked by a Politico report on April 24 that said secret talks were being held by lawmakers to change the requirement to get insurance through the exchanges because of this concern. The headline on the story said Lawmakers, aides may get Obamacare exemption.After the story was published, a spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid said there hadnt been any discussions to exempt Congress from provisions that apply to any employees of any other public or private employer offering health care. And Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California told Politico that lawmakers and their staffs will indeed get insurance through the exchanges. [T]he federal government will offer them health insurance coverage that they obtained through the exchanges because we want to get the same health care coverage everybody else has available to them, he said.We contacted the Office of Personnel Management and received this statement from an administration official: Members of Congress will not receive anything that is not available to the public. The law doesnt allow them to get insurance from FEHB, they are going to get insurance on the market place, just like uninsured individuals and small businesses.We cant say what did or didnt happen in any secret meetings. But we can say that no bill has been introduced to exempt members of Congress from the Affordable Care Act  and they were never exempt in the first place. Even if, hypothetically, Congress were to nullify the provision requiring members and their staffs to get insurance on the exchanges, it still wouldnt amount to an exemption from the law. Lawmakers and staffers would be subject to the mandate to have health insurance or pay a fine, just as everyone else is.The law provides a few exemptions from the requirement to have insurance, but only for those who earn too little to file taxes, those with financial hardships, those who cant find affordable coverage, and some religious groups that qualify for Social Security exemptions, mainly Mennonite or Amish.An Old FalsehoodBogus claims about Congress being exempt date back to early 2010, when different health care bills were still being debated. Some Republicans claimed that Americans, except for members of Congress, would be forced into the government-run public option (which wasnt part of the final bill that became law) or state-based exchanges (which are part of the law).As we said previously, members of Congress get private health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which actually served as a model for the exchanges. Federal workers pick from among many health plans. The exchanges would operate in the same way  like a marketplace for those shopping for private insurance.But some Republicans pushed the idea that if the exchanges were good enough for other Americans, they should be good enough for Congress. So, an amendment by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa was added to the Senate bill requiring that the federal government offer only health plans that were part of an exchange to members of Congress and their staffs. The laws final language on this, written by Sen. Tom Coburn, says that: the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are  (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act.Congressional staff is defined as all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC. As we reported before, Coburn said the provision wouldnt apply to those working for committees or leadership staff, and a Congressional Research Service report agreed that could be the case.In other words, the Affordable Care Act places on lawmakers and their staffs additional requirements that dont pertain to other Americans with work-based insurance.Update, Aug. 7, 2013: The Office of Personnel Management issued a proposed rule on Aug. 7 explaining that members of Congress and applicable congressional staff will be required to purchase health insurance coverage through the exchanges created by the law. However, according to the proposed rule, the federal government, as the employer, will still be able to make a contribution to health insurance premiums as it currently does. The contribution will be no greater than that now offered to members and their staffs under the FEHB program, and members and their staffs will not be eligible for premium tax credits made available to other persons purchasing health insurance through the exchanges. Lori RobertsonSourcesPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Click here for more information.-----The Executive Order signed on January 27, 2017 allows for the proper review and establishment of standards to prevent terrorist or criminal infiltration by foreign nationals. The United States has the worlds most generous immigration system, yet it has been repeatedly exploited by terrorists and other malicious actors who seek to do us harm. In order to ensure that the United States government can conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the national security risks posed from our immigration system, it imposes a 90-day suspension on entry to the United States of nationals of certain designated countriescountries that were designated by Congress and the Obama Administration as posing national security risks in the Visa Waiver Program.In order to protect Americans, and to advance the national interest, the United States must ensure that those entering this country will not harm the American people subsequent to their entry, and that they do not bear n\malicious intent toward the United States and its people. The Executive Order protects the United States from countries compromised by terrorism and ensures a more rigorous vetting process. This Executive Order ensures that we have a functional immigration system that safeguards our national security.This Executive Order, as well as the two issued earlier in the week, provide the Department with additional resources, tools and personnel to carry out the critical work of securing our borders, enforcing the immigration laws of our nation, and ensuring that individuals who pose a threat to national security or public safety cannot enter or remain in our country. Protecting the American people is the highest priority of our government and this Department.The Department of Homeland Security will faithfully execute the immigration laws and the Presidents Executive Order, and we will treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.AuthoritiesThe Congress provided the President of the United States, in section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), with the authority to suspend the entry of any class of aliens the president deems detrimental to the national interest. This authority has been exercised by nearly every president since President Carter, and has been a component of immigration laws since the enactment of the INA in 1952.ActionFor the next 90 days, nearly all travelers, except U.S. citizens, traveling on passports from Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen will be temporarily suspended from entry to the United States. The 90 day period will allow for proper review and establishment of standards to prevent terrorist or criminal infiltration by foreign nationals.Importantly, however, Lawful Permanent Residents of the United States traveling on a valid I-551 will be allowed to board U.S. bound aircraft and will be assessed for exceptions at arrival ports of entry, as appropriate. The entry of these individuals, subject to national security checks, is in the national interest. Therefore, we expect swift entry for these individuals.In the first 30 days, DHS will perform a global country-by-country review of the information each country provides when their citizens apply for a U.S. visa or immigration benefit. Countries will then have 60 days to comply with any requests from the U.S. government to update or improve the quality of the information they provide.DHS and the Department of State have the authority, on a case-by-case basis, to issue visas or allow the entry of nationals of these countries into the United States when it serves the national interest. These seven countries were designated by Congress and the Obama Administration as posing a significant enough security risk to warrant additional scrutiny in the visa waiver context.The Refugee Admissions Program will be temporarily suspended for the next 120 days while DHS and interagency partners review screening procedures to ensure refugees admitted in the future do not pose a security risk to citizens of the United States.The Executive Order does not prohibit entry of, or visa issuance to, travelers with diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas.The Department of Homeland Security along with the Department of State, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will develop uniform screening standards for all immigration programs government-wide.Upon resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, refugee admissions to the United States will not exceed 50,000 for fiscal year 2017.The Secretary of Homeland Security will expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system of all travelers into the United States.Federal GovernmentAs part of a broader set of government actions, the Secretary of State will review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal.The Department of State will restrict the Visa Interview Waiver Program and require additional nonimmigrant visa applicants to undergo an in-person interview.TransparencyThe Department of Homeland Security, in order to be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest will make information available to the public every 180 days. In coordination with the Department of Justice, DHS will provide information regarding the number of foreign nationals charged with terrorism-related offense or gender-based violence against women while in the United States.",Fact Sheet: Protecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry To The United States,1/29/17,,context,context,n,,255,

The K.U.Leuven press release (in Dutch) is here.Press ReleaseKeeLoq is a cipher used in several car anti-theft mechanisms distributed by Microchip Technology Inc. It may protect your car if you own a Chrysler, Daewoo, Fiat, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Volvo, Volkswagen, or Jaguar. The cipher is included in the remote control device that opens and locks your car and that activates the anti-theft mechanisms.Each device has a unique key that takes 18 billion billion values. With 100 computers, it would take several decades to find such a key. Therefore KeeLoq was widely believed to be secure. In our research we have found a method to identify the key in less than a day. The attack requires access for about 1 hour to the remote control (for example, while it is stored in your pocket). Once we have found the key, we can deactivate the alarm and drive away with your car.This research is the joint work between 3 research groups: the computer science department of the Technion, Israel, the research group COSIC of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and the math department of the Hebrew University, Israel.Paper abstractKeeLoq is a lightweight block cipher with a 32-bit block size and a 64-bit key. Despite its short key size, it is widely used in remote keyless entry systems and other wireless authentication applications. For example, authentication protocols based on KeeLoq are supposedly used by various car manufacturers in anti-theft mechanisms. This paper presents a practical key recovery attack against KeeLoq that requires 216 known plaintexts and has a time complexity of 244.5 KeeLoq encryptions. It is based on the slide attack and a novel approach to meet-in-the-middle attacks. The fully implemented attack requires 65 minutes to obtain the required data and 7.8 days of calculations on 64 CPU cores. A variant which requires 216 chosen plaintexts needs only 3.4 days on 64 CPU cores. Using only 10000 euro, an attacker can purchase a cluster of 50 dual core computers that will find the secret key in about two days. We investigated the way KeeLoq is intended to be used in practice and conclude that our attack can be used to subvert the security of real systems. An attacker can acquire chosen plaintexts in practice, and one of the two suggested key derivation schemes for KeeLoq allows to recover the master secret from a single key.Full paper available here:S.

mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bar-code-origin-point/,Can You Determine a Products Country of Origin by Its Bar Code?,Business,28-Oct-08,The first three digits of a bar code indicate a product's country of origin.,http://www.adams1.com/upccode.html#countrycode,16,TRUE,No Error,"This Visit Brought To You ByAll About UPC Barcode & EAN BarcodeThe Universal Product Code or UPC barcode was the first bar code symbology widely adopted. Its birth is usually set at April 3, 1973, when the grocery industry formally established UPC as the standard bar code symbology for product marking. Foreign interest in UPC led to the adoption of the EAN code format, similar to UPC, in December 1976.2005 Sunrise and the Global Trade Item Number initiatives from the UCC will begin on January 1, 2005. This is the ""fourteen digit U.P.C."" that everyone is talking about. There are quite a few misconceptions and considerable misinformation about the effect of this change. In a nutshell, if you are a manufacturer of a product that has an existing 8 or 12-digit UPC barcode, don't worry. You do not have to change anything. However, if you are a retailer or wholesaler with scanners, you potentially are affected. You will need to ensure that scanners are able to decode 8, 12, 13 and 14-digit barcodes (most scanners sold for the last 5 years can do this) and that database systems can handle the extra digits. Gregg London was kind enough to share an excellent white paper on the subject. Once January 1, 2005 comes, both EAN and UPC labels should scan properly worldwide.There are now five versions of UPC and two versions of EAN. The Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) code has a single version identical to one of the EAN versions with the flag characters set to ``49''.UPC and EAN symbols are fixed in length, can only encode numbers, and are continuous symbologies using four element widths.UPC version A symbols have 10 digits plus two overhead digits while EAN symbols have 12 digits and one overhead digit. The first overhead digit of a UPC version A symbol is a number related to the type of product while an EAN symbol uses the first two characters to designate the country of the EAN International organization issuing the number. UPC is in fact a subset of the more general EAN code. Scanners equipped to read EAN symbols can read UPC symbols as well. However, UPC scanners will not necessarily read EAN symbols.The UPC symbology was designed to make it ideal for coding products. UPC can be printed on packages using a variety of printing processes. The format allows the symbol to be scanned with any package orientation. Omnidirectional scanning allows any package orientation provided the symbol faces the scanner. The UPC format can be scanned by hand-held wands and can be printed by equipment in the store. Version A of the symbology has a First Pass Read Rate of 99% using a fixed laser scanner and has a substitution error rate of less than 1 error in 10,000 scanned symbols.Nominal X dimension is 13 mils. A magnification factor of 0.8 to 2.0 is allowed and, as a result, makes a printable range of X dimension values of 10.4 to 24 mils. In other words, the nominal size of a UPC symbol is 1.469"" wide x 1.02"" high. The minimum recommended size is 80% of the nominal size or 1.175"" wide x .816"" high. The maximum recommended size is 200% of the nominal size or 2.938"" wide x 2.04"" high. Larger UPC's scan better. Smaller UPC's do not scan as well or not at all.The UPC format can be printed using a variety of printing techniques because it allows for different ink spreading. The amount of ink spreading depends on printing press conditions, amount and viscosity of ink and other factors which are difficult to precisely control. The UPC symbol is decoded by measuring the distance from leading edges to leading edge of bars, trailing edge to trailing edge of bars and leading edge to leading edge of characters. Since relative distances are measured for decoding, uniform ink spread will not affect the symbol's readability. However, excessive ink spread will make the spaces very small to the point that the reader will be unable to resolve them. Since UPC is a continuous code with exacting tolerances, it is more difficult to print on any equipment except printing presses.How Do I Get A Bar Code Number For My Product?See the FAQ for the answer.How Do I Get A List Of All The Product Codes And Their Respective Manufacturers?See the FAQ for the answer.Do I Have To Pay To Use Barcodes For Internal Uses Like Inventory?See the FAQ for the answer.UPC Version A BarcodeUPC version A is the basic version of UPC and is usually the version seen on grocery store items. The symbology is used to encode the 10 digit Universal Product Code. An eleventh digit indicates the type of product, and a twelfth digit is a modulo check digit. The symbol is divided into two halves, each containing 5 digits. The two six-digit patterns are surrounded by left, center and right guard patterns. The left six digits use odd parity encodation while the right six digits use even parity encodation.. The first digit is the UPC number system digit related to the type of product (0 for groceries, 3 for drugs, etc.). The next 5 digits are the UPC manufacturer's code. The first five digits of the right half are the product code. The final digit is the check digit. Although UPC A is continuous, the left and right halves of the symbol can be independently decoded.A digit is coded as a sequence of two bars and two spaces within a space 7 modules wide. Bar and space widths may be 12, 3, or 4 modules wide. This results in 20 possible bar-space combinations. Ten of these patterns are used for the left odd parity digits and ten are used for the right even parity digits. The left digits always start with a space, while the right digits always start with a bar.Left DigitsOdd ParityS B S B Right DigitEven ParityB S B S 0 3 2 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 3 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2 5 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 6 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 7 1 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 8 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 3 9 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 2A typical UPC Version A symbol has center guard bars in the center of the symbol which are longer than the other bars. This divides the symbol into a right and left half. This division allows the symbol to scan in any orientation. The moving beam laser bar code reader in grocery stores produces orthogonal scanning beams either in a cross, starburst, or figure-eight. At least one beam will then pass through each half of the symbol, since the symbol's height is at least equal to half of the length of the symbol.The height of the symbol should be at least half the length of the symbol. Sometimes the symbol's height is shortened to fit into the design of the package. This truncation of symbol height affects the ability to scan the symbol in any orientation, and will generally reduce the First Pass Read Rate.The Quiet Zone should be 9 modules on the left and right of the symbol.Version A may include either a 2 digit or a 5 digit supplemental encodation. These extra digits are primarily used on periodicals and books.More information about Version A is available here.UPC Version E BarcodeUPC version E is the next most common version of UPC. It is a zero suppression version of UPC. It is intended to be used on packaging which would be otherwise too small to use one of the other versions. The code is smaller because it drops out zeros which would otherwise occur in a symbol. For example, the code 59300-00066 would be encoded as 593663. The last digit (3 in the example) indicates the type of compression. Guard bars precede and follow the data (no middle guard bars). The digits are coded following the parity pattern EVEN, EVEN, ODD, ODD, EVEN, ODD. The data is enclosed between two left-hand guard bars and three right-hand guard bars. The six digit number is always preceded by a 0 and followed by the check digit. The way the check digit is computed is by expanding the type E to a type A, then doing the regular check.More information about Version E along with a converter is available here.There is a good explanation of Zero Suppression at the Infinity Graphics site with a table that shows how a Version A number may be reduced to Version E if the Numbering System Character is ""0"".Other UPC Barcode VersionsThere are three other versions of UPC. These other versions are not in wide use.UPC version B is a special version originally developed to handle the National Drug Code and National Health Related Items Code. It allows for 11 digits plus one product type code. This version does not have any modulo check digit.UPC version C is a special code designed to promote industry-wide compatibility. The code is 12 digits long with a product type digit and a modulo check sum digit.UPC version D is a variable message length version of UPC. The symbol must contain at least 12 digits. The first digit is a product type code. This is followed by 10 information carrying digits. The twelfth digit is a modulo check sum, and this is followed by a variable number of digits.There is a good explanation of the UPC Shipping Container Symbol (SCS) at the Infinity Graphics site.EAN-13 Barcode and EAN-8 BarcodeThe EAN Article Numbering System (EAN),the Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) System and the International Article Numbering System (IAN) are identical to UPC except for the number of digits. The Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) System (JAN) codes are the same as the EAN codes, with the flag characters set to ``49''. There are two principal EAN versions.Standard EAN (sometimes called EAN-13 or DUN-13) has 10 numeric characters, 2 or 3 ""flag"" characters which are usually a code for the country of the EAN International organization issuing the number , and a check digit. In all other respects, it is identical to UPC version A. JAN is the same as EAN-13. For compatibility with UPC, flags 00, 01, 03, 04, and 06 through 13 are assigned to the United States.Lots of people have requested the codes. Here is a partial list. Remember, it indicates the country that issued the code, NOT THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE PRODUCT. The abbreviation ""MO"" stands for Member Organization. The meaning of the prefixes """"020-029"", ""040-049"" and ""200-299"" are set by the GS1 administration in a given country. GS1-US has defined these prefixes as for internal use in, for example, warehouses.

(Nicki Demarco/The Washington Post)After the proposal to expand background checks as a part of gun legislation failed to win enough votes in the Senate Wednesday, President Obama expressed his disappointment and said this is only the beginning to pushing for reform. (Nicki Demarco/The Washington Post)President Obamas ambitious effort to overhaul the nations gun laws in response to Decembers school massacre in Connecticut suffered a resounding defeat Wednesday, when every major proposal he championed fell apart on the Senate floor.It was a stunning collapse for gun-control advocates just four months after the deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown led the president and many others to believe that the political climate on guns had been altered in their favor.The national drive for laws that might prevent another mass shooting unraveled under intense pressure from the gun rights lobby, which used regional and cultural differences among senators to prevent new firearms restrictions.One by one, the Senate blocked or defeated proposals that would ban certain military-style assault rifles and limit the size of ammunition magazines.But the biggest setback for the White House was the defeat of a measure to expand background checks to most gun sales. The Senate defied polls showing that nine in 10 Americans support the idea, which was designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.All in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington, a visibly angry Obama said as he delivered his response to the nation.The president was flanked by Newtown families, a scowling Vice President Biden and former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in 2011 in Tucson and limped from the Oval Office to join Obama in the Rose Garden.The fierce confrontation on Capitol Hill over an issue that has divided Americans for decades is likely to continue, but any legislation that may ultimately pass probably would be far more modest than the measures Obama had championed.Newtown thrust gun control to the top of the presidents second-term agenda, and he spent considerable political capital campaigning for his proposals. But he was unable to translate overwhelming popular support into legislative action.Background checks for all gun buyers, long considered the most politically palatable of Obamas proposals, were the linchpin and last week had seemed poised for passage after a pair of pro-gun senators, Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), announced a compromise deal.Yet even a late flurry of meetings between senators and Sandy Hook Elementary School parents was not enough to bend the will of Democratic centrists and more moderate Republicans. Although they had been open to expanded background checks, many of them voted no.Obama sounded exasperated that senators were not more responsive to public opinion and did not offer what he considered worthy explanations for why they voted down the measures.The president lashed out at the National Rifle Association for having willfully lied about the background-check proposal to stoke fear among gun rights supporters that Congress would violate their Second Amendment rights or create a federal gun registry.And he laid the blame squarely on Republicans, although four Democrats also opposed the bill.Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea, but its not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans just voted against it, Obama said, adding that they had caved to the pressure.Obama insisted that Wednesdays votes were round one and pledged to do everything he can to take further action. He also warned of political consequences in the 2014 midterm elections.We can do more if Congress gets its act together, Obama said. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and enact common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.The NRA celebrated the collapse of the Manchin-Toomey proposal.This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution, NRA chief lobbyist Chris W. Cox said in a statement.Republican opponents said the Manchin-Toomey amendment eventually would have led to a national gun registry, but the proposal included language outlawing a federal registry. They also said it would do little to prevent mass shootings while creating an imposition for law-abiding citizens, especially those in rural areas.My biggest concern with the legislation, the Democrat legislation on the floor, is it doesnt address the problem, said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). It doesnt target violent criminals. Instead, what it does is, it targets law-abiding citizens.The NRA galvanized its members to pepper senators with letters, e-mails, phone calls and appearances at town hall meetings, which convinced enough of them that voting for the measures would jeopardize their reelection prospects.A series of votes Wednesday afternoon revealed insufficient Republican support for all of the proposals Obama sought. First, just four Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in a 54 to 46 vote for the Manchin-Toomey background-check proposal, leaving supporters short of the 60-vote threshold required for approval. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) voted no to preserve special privileges to call another vote on the amendment at any time.In other votes, just 40 senators supported the assault-weapons ban and 46 supported limiting the size of ammunition magazines. In addition, an NRA-backed measure that clarified gun-trafficking laws fell short, with just 58 votes, stunning Democrats.More senators, 57, voted for a provision that would greatly expand gun rights  allowing people with permits to carry concealed weapons in their states to carry them nationwide  than supported expanding background checks.Weve got to bring these votes back to the American people, said freshman Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). This is worse than I ever thought.The raw emotion of the defeat played out in the Senate gallery just after Biden, presiding over the Senate, read the vote count.Shame on you, at least two women were heard shouting.As police escorted them from the Capitol, Patricia Maisch and Lori Haas said they were angry. Maisch knocked a large ammunition magazine out of the hands of Jared Lee Loughner in January 2011 after he shot Giffords and other bystanders.They are an embarrassment to this country, Maisch said as officers tried to remove her from the building. I hate them, she added of the senators.Haas, whose daughter, Emily, was wounded in the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, said: Were sick and tired of the death in this country, and these legislators stand up there and think its a bunch of numbers. . . . Its a shame, its appalling, its disgusting.Moments earlier, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), who had been absent in recent months as he battled cancer, was brought to the floor by wheelchair. When a clerk called his name, the 89-year-old shouted, Aye.Lautenbergs Democratic colleagues applauded, but his vote was not enough.Inside the White House, officials privately expressed frustration and dismay that Obama and Biden had, polls show, sold the public on their proposals through a series of campaign-style events but that the inside game of lining up Senate votes was not as well organized.The key senators in play came from Southern and rural states  including Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). And yet New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) quickly became the public face of gun control at a time when conservatives turned him into their boogeyman for his efforts to limit the size of soft drinks. This week, for instance, the NRA ran banner ads on news Web sites urging voters to oppose Bloomberg & Obama.Bloomberg, who financed television advertisements pressuring senators, said Wednesdays vote was a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington.Within minutes of the vote, there were calls to unseat opposing senators when they stand for reelection.The U.S. Senate decided to do the unthinkable about gun violence  nothing at all, Giffords wrote in an e-mail to supporters. Its clear to me that if members of the U.S. Senate refuse to change the laws to reduce gun violence, then we need to change the members of the U.S. Senate.Some leading gun-control advocates acknowledged that it was too difficult to begin a national debate after the Newtown shootings and expect a successful outcome just four months later.When Obama traveled to Newtown in December to eulogize the victims, he vowed to use whatever power this office holds to enact changes that could prevent gun violence. And he did. But some allies said he should have begun his effort sooner, such as after Giffords was shot two years ago.Post-Newtown, the presidents been wonderful, but if more of this had happened after the Giffords shooting, maybe we couldve laid the groundwork then to get something passed now, said Paul Helmke, a former president of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence.Gun-control supporters were buoyed last week as Manchin and Toomeys compromise appeared to gain momentum, but saw the vote count slip away this week amid what advocates decried as a campaign of misinformation by the NRA.At a private luncheon Tuesday, Manchin made an appeal to his Democratic colleagues, a senior Democrat said. Manchin said Newtown parents told him they understood that the background-check amendment would not have prevented their tragedy because the alleged shooters mother had bought the weapons legally, but that it could prevent a future massacre.That was enough, Manchin said in an interview later. If you can do that and youre sent here  and we all take that oath  shouldnt you do it?Paul Kane and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums.",Gun-control overhaul is defeated in Senate,4/17/13,,irrelevant,context,context,,260,

Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add InterestToday is the single biggest day of voting in the presidential race until Novembers general election. Voters in 12 states and one territory will have a critical say in the course of the rest of the election.Heres a breakdown of everything you need to know:History of 'Super Tuesday'The phrase Super Tuesday was first used in the 1980s when Alabama, Georgia and Florida all held their primaries on the same day.That number grew to nine four years later. That presidential election year, former Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale survived the loss of seven states to his main opponent, but nabbed the eventual nomination at the Democratic National Convention.In 1988, the foundation for todays Super Tuesday was created, Southern Super Tuesday, and included mostly Southern states. Until 2004, these Southern primaries were held the week following Super Tuesday.Today, the day when the greatest number of states hold primary elections has been dubbed the SEC Primary because many of the states that vote are represented in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), a U.S. college athletic conference.Which states will be voting?Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia will hold primaries for both parties. Alaska will host only a Republican primary; American Samoa, only a Democratic one.In Colorado, there will be caucuses for both parties. But only the Democrats in that state will be choosing their candidates. Colorado Republicans have opted to vote for the delegates who will represent them at the Republican National Convention in July.What is a delegate and how many delegates are at stake on Super Tuesday?Delegates are selected from each state to cast their votes for a presidential nominee at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in July. The number of delegates and how they are selected varies from state to state.There are two kinds of delegates: pledged, who must vote based on primary and caucus results; and unpledged, or super, who are permanent delegates and can vote for whom they please at the conventions.A Republican candidate must receive 1,237 delegates out of the total 2,472 available to be eligible for the nomination. For the Democrats, that number is 2,383 out of the total 4,765 delegates.There are 595 delegates at stake for the Republicans today, about 20 percent of the total GOP delegates. An 1,015 delegates are up for grabs for the Democrats.How many delegates do the candidates have so far?There have been election events for both parties in four states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.On the GOP side, these are the current delegate counts: Donald Trump: 82 Ted Cruz: 17 Marco Rubio: 16 John Kasich: 6 Ben Carson: 4For the Democrats, without counting super-delegates, Hillary Clinton has 91 and Bernie Sanders has 65 delegates.Super Tuesday VisitsBefore the results rolled in during the South Carolina primary last month, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was already on to the Super Tuesday States, but he wasnt the only one. Republican presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich hit the trail for Georgia as supporters were casting their ballots in the Nevada caucuses last month. So, just how many times did each candidate pay a Super Tuesday state a visit? Lets take a look.Donald Trump: 27 Ted Cruz: 35 Marco Rubio: 18 John Kasich: 18 Ben Carson: 26And on the other side of the aisle,Hillary Clinton: 25 Bernie Sanders: 24*does not include number of stops made in each state or visits for interviews-fundraising.Whos leading where?The New York real estate mogul, Donald Trump, is leading the GOP field in Tennessee and Georgia, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading in his home state, according to new polls released Sunday. In the latest Quinnipiac polls, Trump is also shown holding a lead in Florida, the home state of main GOP rival Sen. Marco Rubio, and Ohio, the home state of Gov. John Kasich. The pressure is on for Cruz, Rubio and Kasich to come out on top in their home states, where a potential loss could go as far as costing them their campaign.Who can vote?Voting rules vary based on the states kind of election. Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia all have open primaries. This means that a registered voter in these states, regardless of their party registration, can cast their ballot for a candidate in either party.Oklahoma has a closed primary and American Samoa, Alaska, Colorado and Minnesota all have closed caucuses. Voters in these states must vote for a candidate within their registered party. Massachusetts has a modified closed primary where registered Republicans and Democrats must vote in their own parties, but independents can choose to affiliate with either party once they get to the polls. Democrats living abroad may also vote in their global presidential primary beginning on Super Tuesday.What Happened Last Time?In 2008, the last election without an incumbent candidate, Super Tuesday was a decisive victory for Sen. John McCain, who would go on to become the GOP nominee. In the Democratic race, Super Tuesday did not provide a clear victory for either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Although Obama won more states overall, Clinton won states with higher numbers of delegates.ABC News Alana Abramson contributed to this report.Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

Now its Barack and Michelle Obamas turn.In an interview about his new book, God, Guns, Grits and Gravy, Huckabee tells PEOPLE he doesnt get how the Obamas can encourage their daughters love for Beyonc. Especially, the former Arkansas governor and Baptist minister says, if the president and first lady ever actually listened to the lyrics to  or seen a performance of Beyoncs steamy Drunk in Love.The Obamas are excellent and exemplary parents in many ways, Huckabee says.Thats the whole point. I dont understand how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the intake of everything  how much broccoli they eat and where they go to school and making sure theyre kind of sheltered and shielded from so many things  and yet they dont see anything that might not be suitable for either a preteen or a teen in some of the lyrical content and choreography of Beyonc, who has sort of a regular key to the door of the White House.Beyonc, Jay Z and their daughter, Blue Ivy, were at the White House last January for Mrs. Obamas exclusive 50th birthday bash and the first lady has taken her girls to several Beyonc concerts.The singer, criticized in Huckabees book for obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics and dance moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom, was also featured prominently at the presidents second Inauguration in 2013.The first ladys office had no response to Huckabees comments.Huckabee, who signed off from his Fox News talk show earlier this month to weigh another presidential run, says he wants this book to expose what he calls the vast disconnect between the cultural norms of where people actually live  in flyover country  versus the three great bubbles of influence in Washington, D.C., New York City and Hollywood.And all the online chatter stoked by his Beyonc passages only proves the disconnect, he says. Its like people are shocked that I would raise that as an issue. My response to that is, Gee, the mouse took the cheese.'Huckabee says hes a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan (She was terrific in The Hunger Games. I find her an amazing actress), lists Dallas Buyers Club as a favorite flick, and gasps at the suggestion he could be labeled a prude.Oh, Heavens no, he says. Not at all! He cites his 11-year record as Arkansas governor, when Arkansas was one of the only states in America where every student grades K through 12 had to have both music and art classes. Im one of the strongest advocates for the arts youll ever find!And for all his thunder against some stars of pop culture (Miley Cyrus twerking was a disgustingly pornographic performance and, of a mesh dress worn by Rihanna, he writes Ive seen dusty pickup truck windshields that were less see-through), Huckabees not calling for any censorship or regulation.Government shouldnt try to dictate what art looks like or what it portrays, he says. Last thing we want is government screwiung it up, which is what they would do.As for any 2016 bid for the White House, Huckabee says hell decide sometime this spring and, if its a yes, he wants some of the only reality TV stars he can stomach  the Duggars of TLCs 19 Kids & Counting beside him.Ive pointed them out as an example of something thats wholesome and wonderful and Ive known them since Jim Bob was in the legislature when I was governor, says Huckabee. The Duggars campaigned for Huckabee in 2008. Should I run, Im hoping theyll do it again.

mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-more-registered-voters-than-adults/,Does the U.S. Have Millions More Registered Voters Than Eligible Adults?,Politics  Politics,09-Apr-18,"The U.S. has several million more registered voters than eligible, voting-age adults.",https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/08/election-fraud-registered-voters-outnumber-eligible-voters-462-counties/,3,TRUE,No Error,"Polling place in Westminster, Colo., November 2014 (Reuters photo: Rick Wilking)At least 3.5 million more people are on U.S. election rolls than are eligible to vote.Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among Americas adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to voter fraud.The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch  a Washington-based legal-watchdog group  analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureaus 20112015 American Community Survey and last months statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. According to Judicial Watch, eleven states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvanias legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.AdvertisementAdvertisementMy tabulation of Judicial Watchs state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties.AdvertisementThats enough over-registered voters to populate a ghost-state about the size of Connecticut, Judicial Watch attorney Robert Popper told me.These 462 counties (18.5 percent of the 2,500 studied) exhibit this ghost-voter problem. These range from 101 percent registration in Delawares New Castle County to New Mexicos Harding County, where there are 62 percent more registered voters than living, breathing adult citizens  or a 162 percent registration rate.Washingtons Clark County is worrisome, given its 154 percent registration rate. This includes 166,811 ghost voters. Georgias Fulton County seems less nettlesome at 108 percent registration, except for the number of Greater Atlantans, 53,172, who compose that figure.But Californias San Diego County earns the enchilada grande. Its 138 percent registration translates into 810,966 ghost voters. Los Angeles Countys 112 percent rate equals 707,475 over-registrations. Beyond the official data that it received, Judicial Watch reports that LA County employees informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144 percent of the total number of resident citizens of voting age.AdvertisementAll told, California is a veritable haunted house, teeming with 1,736,556 ghost voters. Judicial Watch last week wrote Democratic secretary of state Alex Padilla and authorities in eleven Golden State counties and documented how their election records are in shambles.AdvertisementCalifornias voting rolls are an absolute mess that undermines the very idea of clean elections, said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton in a statement. It is urgent that California take reasonable steps to clean up its rolls. We will sue if state officials fail to act.Ronald Reagans California has devolved into a reliably far-Left stronghold. While pristine voter rolls should be a given in a constitutional republic with democratic elections, even that improvement might be too little to make Americas most populous state competitive in presidential elections.The same cannot be said for battleground states, in which Electoral College votes can be decided by incredibly narrow margins. Consider the multitude of ghost voters in: Colorado: 159,373 Florida: 100,782 Iowa: 31,077 Michigan: 225,235 New Hampshire: 8,211 North Carolina: 189,721 Virginia: 89,979(For a deeper dive into these data, please download my spreadsheet here .)President Donald J. Trumps supporters might be intrigued to learn that Hillary Clintons margins of victory in Colorado (136,386) and New Hampshire (2,736) were lower than the numbers of ghost voters in those states. Clintons fans should know that Trump won Michigan (10,704) and North Carolina (173,315) by fewer ballots than ghost voters in those states.Its past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.Perhaps these facts will encourage Democrats to join the GOP-dominated effort to remove ineligible felons, ex-residents, non-citizens, and dead people from the voter rolls  for all contests, not just presidential races.AdvertisementWhen you have an extremely large number of stale names on the voter rolls in a county, it makes voter fraud much easier to commit, Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R., Kan.), co-chairman of President Trumps Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, told me. Its easier to identify a large number of names of people who have moved away or are deceased. At that point, if there is no photo-ID requirement in the state, those identities can be used to vote fraudulently.In fact, CBSs Windy City affiliate last October compared local vote records with the Social Security Administrations master death file. In all, the channel concluded, the analysis showed 119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade. KCBSLos Angeles reported in May 2016 that 265 dead voters had cast ballots in southern California year after year.Under federal law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the 2002 Help America Vote Act require states to maintain accurate voter lists. Nonetheless, some state politicians ignore this law. Others go further: Governor Terry McAuliffe (D., Va.) vetoed a measure last February that would have mandated investigations of elections in which ballots cast outnumbered eligible voters.AdvertisementEven more suspiciously, when GOP governor Rick Scott tried to obey these laws and update Floridas records, including deleting 51,308 deceased voters, Obamas Justice Department filed a federal lawsuit to stop him. Federal prosecutors claimed that Governor Scotts statewide efforts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act, although it applies to only five of Floridas 67 counties. Thenattorney general Eric Holder and his team behaved as if Martin Luther King Jr. and the Freedom Riders fought so valiantly in order to keep cadavers politically active.Whether Americans consider vote fraud a Republican hoax, a Democratic tactic, or something in between, everyone should agree that its past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.AdvertisementREAD MORE:Why Are Democrats Afraid of the Election Integrity Commission?The Obama Administrations Ugly Legacy of Undermining Electoral IntegrityThe Left Is Undermining Confidence in Our Elections","Election Fraud?

Prescott College is proud to announce the availability of this scholarship to one undocumented student as part of National Institutions Coming Out Day in support of undocumented students, an annual event hosted by United We Dream.This is the first time a four-year college in Arizona has implemented such a fee, and only the second in the country to do so. The fee was a student led initiative with collaboration between undergraduate and Social Justice and Human Rights Master of Arts students, community members, and faculty members.Prescott College President John Flicker says, I am proud that our students take on the role of scholar activists. The passion around this issue really motivated our part to make up the difference between what the fee will provide for and the full cost to attend one of our programs. Were committed to broaden access to higher education for a diverse group of students and mobilize our resources towards social justice.The fee will support one student this coming academic year, but the College hopes to raise additional funds to support more full tuition scholarships for additional undocumented students, who are not eligible to receive federal financial aid.Within the current political landscape of Arizona it is critical that Prescott College shows our commitment to education as a human right, says Miriel Manning, founder of the Freedom Education Fund and student in the Social Justice and Human Rights Master of Arts program. We were inspired by courageous leadership and organizing of undocumented leaders across the country.At Prescott College, the application process and financial aid are open to all students, including both undocumented and DACA-status students. Students interested in applying for the Freedom Education Fund scholarship should contact Admissions at (928) 350-2100 or Financial Aid at (928) 350-1111.Anyone interested in building the Freedom Education Fund can donate at freedom.education.fund.kintera.org, or contact Miriel Manning at _EMAIL_ to get involved.Frequently Asked QuestionsWho is eligible for this scholarship? What qualifies as undocumented?The recipients will be undocumented, full-time or part-time undergraduate or graduate students at Prescott College that demonstrate financial need. A qualified applicant for the Fund must not be a legal permanent resident and not possess a green card, visa, or other legal documentation. Undocumented status also includes individuals who have been granted conditional resident status or a deferred removal action under federal law and individuals that were born outside of the United States but have lived in this country for a significant portion of their lives.Undocumented students cannot receive federal financial aid.Undocumented students are not eligible for federal or state loans.Many state universities charge undocumented students out-of-state tuition even if they have been living in the state long enough to have residency. Many other universities charge them international student tuition which is much more expensive than in-state.Until 2012, when DACA passed, no undocumented students could legally work which highly limited their ability to put themselves through school. Now some undocumented students have work permits through DACA, but not all.What is DACA?DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.On June 15, 2012, President Obama signed a memo calling for deferred action for certain undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children and have pursued education or military service. Eligible undocumented students who have a valid I-766 and can demonstrate residency in Arizona, are considered for in-state tuition status at Pima Community College. (Scholarships A-Z definition)Is it illegal to give aid to undocumented students?Undocumented students are not expressly prohibited by law from admission to state colleges and universities. No federal statutes require disclosure and proof of immigration status and citizenship for students to enter higher education.How many undocumented students graduate from high school every year?Only 5-10% of the estimated 65,000 undocumented high school graduates who have been in the U.S at least 5 years go on to attend higher education.Why is there a Monarch butterfly in the logo?The Monarch butterfly, or mariposa in Spanish, is a symbol used throughout the Migrant Justice movement by artists and activists alike. The Monarch butterfly represents the resiliency and strength of a warrior and the right to move freely across political borders.Monarch Butterflies are known for their mass migration of 3,000 miles over North America through multiple generations. We chose this as a symbol of how the Freedom Education Fund is part of a national movement for justice and freedom.Why Freedom Education Fund?The struggle for access education for undocumented students is part of many larger social movements of our time. Real freedom means collective liberation- that no one of us is free unless all of us are free. We invoke freedom not as a declaration that this scholarship is freedom, but that it is a step towards a larger vision for justice; education should be free and accessible for all.Are there other schools that have scholarships specifically for undocumented students?Yes! There are over 45 other public, private colleges, and universities that offer institutional and endowed scholarships specifically to undocumented students. Additionally, 18 states now offer in-state tuition to students who are undocumented.I do believe in education for all and I know this scholarship fund will make higher education a possibility for someone that may have thought that they could never get one, or that it was very difficult or nearly impossible to do it. With the help of other scholarships, I was able to make my own college graduation a reality, so I hope that this college fund will be able to do the same for others.

I am a Marine who doesnt recognize color because every color has lived and died for you. You live in a free country to blame your life on the color of another mans skin. All colors have given their lives for an educated woman to have the freedom to be so ignorant. I dont blame black people for the ignorance that comes from your mouth. I love all colors because I love all that God creates. I dont have to like you to love you because we cant always like the ones we love. Just because I dont like you today doesnt mean I cant like you tomorrow. I dont like you or your husband today because of what youre doing to this country. Isnt it funny how the truth always reveals itself in time. You and your husband never showed this side of yourselves in 2008 before he was elected.You both live better than 99% of the people in this world because of this country. You said that you are for the first time proud to be an American. Well, I will tell you that most of us are ashamed of you. You and your husband have become millionaires off the people of this country, but demonstrate very little appreciation for all that we give. White, black, brown or indifferent millions have fought and died for you to have the freedom to say the ignorant things you say. You are educated, but clearly have very little common sense. You blame past generations of Americans for the troubles of a few. Stop blaming white people for your misery and take a look at yourself in the mirror. We are responsible for our own happiness and misery. The KKK is ignorance wrapped in a sheet while the Black panthers are raised on ignorance and hate. No different from the teaching of Islam thinking their race is better than all other men. God is love and creates every color to include everyones skin. To truly love God is to love all that He loves. For that I love each of you and pray that we all start taking responsibility for our own damned sins.Martin Luther King had a dream that we would all live in the promise land. He is not remembered for being black. He is remembered for the love, and character he had within his heart. If you dont like this country get on that plane and never come back. I will stay here and love all Americans, regardless of skin. I will love the beauty of what God created and stand tall with my American friends. Not because of their color but for the character and love they carry within. This country doesnt owe you anymore than it owes me. So many have thanked me for my service and I will always be grateful. I pray that one day you and your husband might cause me to be grateful for yours. You will never be remembered as the First Lady of Color but soon forgotten after you leave the White House. You nor your husband shall ever divide us. I wish you no harm, but pray you will take your troubles to a land you no longer hate. Hate shall come and go but His love shall last forever. If you wish to find me I am now a writer for the DC Gazette. #Marine4Truth Also on Twitter @mshep08_mike I have included the interview I gave to the wonderful people of Australia, explaining my reason for writing this letter.

The Xerces Society says its goal is to protect nature's pollinators and invertebrates, which play a vital role in the health of the overall ecosystem.The nonprofit organization was involved in the initial petitions to protect the bee species, said Sarina Jepson, director of endangered species and aquatic programs for the Portland, Oregon-based group.Jepson said yellow-faced bees can be found elsewhere in the world, but these particular species are native only to Hawaii and pollinate plant species indigenous to the islands.The bees face a variety of threats including ""feral pigs, invasive ants, loss of native habitat due to invasive plants, fire, as well as development, especially in some for the coastal areas,"" Jepson told The Associated Press.The bees can be found in a wide variety of habitats in Hawaii, from coastal environments to high-elevation shrub lands, she said. The yellow-faced bees pollinate some of Hawaii's endangered native plant species. While other bees could potentially pollinate those species, many could become extinct if these bees were to die off entirely.Hawaii-based entomologist Karl Magnacca worked with Xerces on much of the initial research. It has taken almost 10 years to get to this point, he told the AP. ""It's good to see it to finally come to fruition,"" he said.The bees ""tend to favor the more dominant trees and shrubs we have here,"" he said. ""People tend to focus on the rare plants, and those are important, that's a big part of the diversity. But the other side is maintaining the common ones as common. (The bees) help maintain the structure of the whole forest.""Magnacca added that there are a lot more rare insects that deserve protection. ""It may not necessarily be appropriate to list them as endangered, but we have this huge diversity that we need to work on and protect here in Hawaii,"" he said. ""There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done.""The bees are critical for maintaining the health of plants and other animals across the islands, said Gregory Koob, conservation and restoration team manager for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Honolulu.There is no designated critical habitat attached to the listing, he said, but the protection will allow authorities to implement recovery programs, access funding and limit their harm from outside sources. All federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife service when interacting with endangered species.""As an animal, it can't be taken or harmed or killed by individuals,"" Koob said. ""Any research that is done needs a permit from Fish and Wildlife Service unless it's done by a state agency.""Koob said that if the bees were removed from ecosystem, the plants that they pollinate would likely not survive.""Those plants are not only food and nesting habitat for the bees, but they also provide habitat for other animals,"" he said. ""It's the web of life.""Friday's listing finalized the protection of 10 animal species in Hawaii, the seven bees along with the band-rumped storm-petrel, the orangeblack Hawaiian damselfly and the anchialine pool shrimp. It also added 39 species of plants native to Hawaii.The rusty-patched bumble bee, found widely across the continental United States, is also being considered for protection.___Find more stories by AP's Caleb Jones at _LINKS_ Follow Jones on Twitter: _LINKS_","Feds list 7 Hawaii bee species as endangered, a first in US",,,right,context,right,,270,

However, according to research conducted by Japanese scientists, e-cigarettes contain 10 times the level of cancer-causing carcinogens than regular cigarettes.In the research commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Health, it was found that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde carcinogens are present, and prevalent, in the liquid produced by many e-cigarette products. Furthermore, it was determined that e-cigarettes can fuel potentially life-threatening drug-resistant pathogens. This discovery comes from a lab study that tested the vapor from e-cigarettes on live methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human cells. According to a Japanese Ministry of Health official, the formaldehyde carcinogen is much more present in the e-cigarette liquids than in the chemicals used in regular cigarettes. In one brand of e-cigarette the team found more than 10 times the level of carcinogens contained in one regular cigarette. Especially when the wire (which vaporizes the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced, said researcher Naoki Kunugita. Kunugita also added that the levels of the formaldehyde carcinogen varied in the final results. You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco. The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to underage people because they posed potentially serious health risks. The UN health agency said that although theres a lack of evidence regarding the damage caused by e-cigarettes, theres still enough evidence to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age about their use. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) more than a quarter of a million youth who had never smoked a cigarette used electronic cigarettes in 2013. This number reflects a three-fold increase, from about 79,000 in 2011, to more than 263,000 in 2013. What do you think of these findings?

This week, the states Republican-led senate passed the so-called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight.The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security. The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public. The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution  an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide  the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.What could go wrong?Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a polite society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less. The narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms, shootings like the one in Charleston, South Carolina, could be prevented.The premise, as tempting as it sounds for would-be vigilantes, has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice. Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of good guys with guns tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. Weve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who wont even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger. A militarized church security unit assigned by the church, trained by the church, and meant to protect the church by any means necessary. If Mississippi legislators cant see the inherent danger in this as the bill heads to the House of Representatives to be finalized, then we are in a lot of trouble.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images",Mississippi Senate OKs Bill Giving Church Members License To Kill Perceived Threats,3/30/16,Jameson Parker,right,right,n,,273,

The scientist operating the device was John G. Trump, a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Trump was working the controls and explaining how high-speed electrons ran along a porcelain tube to a water-cooled gold target, when suddenly two of the high-voltage sparks hit him squarely on the nose. And yet, according to the A.P. account, the direct strike caused him only slight discomfort. Professor Trump told the reporter, Thats an advantage of this machine. Its completely grounded and those sparks cant kill you.If only the same could be said of the Presidential campaign run by Professor Trumps nephew, Donald J. Trump. He is still uncomfortably close to victory, which is why there have been, lately, more serious attempts to figure out what he might do if, say, he had access to nuclear weapons. In his answers, he seldom sounds as ungrounded as when he invokes Professor Trump, the younger brother of his father, Fred. My uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was nuclear, Trump said in one interview, before nuclear referring, perhaps, to the development of hydrogen bombs, rather than basic atomic bombs (which occurred when Donald was about six years old), or perhaps just to that netherworld where things wait until Trump judges them to be fashionable or flashy enough to exist. He mentions his uncle so often, and in such extravagant termsbrilliant, one of the top, top professors at M.I.T.that it seems worth asking what the professor and his arcane knowledge mean to him. There are two different sets of answers, which might be put into the category of foreign and domestic.But first, given Trumps tendency to wrap things in porcelain and gold and shoot sparks through them, its worth noting that John Trump really does seem to have been a brilliant scientist. He was at M.I.T. for decades, and the X-ray machines he helped design provided additional years of life to cancer patients throughout the world, as the Times put it in his obituary, in 1985. Trump was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and in 1943 the F.B.I. had enough faith in his technical ability and his discretion to call him in when Nikola Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel, in Manhattan, raising the question of whether enemy agents might have had a chance to learn some of his secrets before the body was found. (One fear was that Tesla was working on a death ray.) As Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth recount in Tesla, Master of Lightning, Professor Trump examined Teslas papers and equipment, and, in a written report, told the F.B.I. not to worry: Teslas thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character, but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. Professor Trump may have neglected to make that sort of distinction clear to his nephew.What is strange is that Donald Trump couples tales of how he received early, secret word from his uncle that nuclear weapons were dangerous and getting more soHe would tell me, There are things that are happening that could be potentially so bad for the world in terms of weaponry, he told the Boston Globewith a casual indifference about proliferation. In recent interviews, Trump has said that if countries like Japan and South Korea didnt want to pay America more for military protection, they should go and build their own nuclear weapons. When, in one seesawing exchange, Anderson Cooper asked if this meant he was for proliferation, Trump first disagreed, citingnaturallythe professor. I hate nuclear more than any. My uncle was a professor was at M.I.T., used to tell me about nuclear, Trump said. But then he added, Can I be honest with you? Its going to happen, anyway. Its going to happen anyway. Its only a question of time . . . Now, wouldnt you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons? (Actually, no.)Its true that nuclear weapons are not that hard for a determined country to acquire, which is why the best counter-proliferation tool is diplomacythat is, deal-making, which Trump prides himself on and yet, in this case, tosses aside. Last week, President Obama attended an international summit on nuclear weapons, in Washington, and said in a press conference that the representatives of other countries had told him they were worried about Trump, who, Obama said, doesnt know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.It gets stranger still when Trump invokes the bomb as a way to dismiss talk of climate change: The only global warming Im worried about is nuclear global warming. Was he thinking of the nuclear winter, but got it backward? Or of the heat generated when bombs, which his uncle told him would be nuclear even before there was nuclear, detonate? It may be, as is so often the case, that looking for the logic in Trumps comments is a pointless exercise. But they might provide an outline, at least, of a world view. When Trump told the Times that his uncle would tell me many years ago about the power of weapons someday, that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive, that its going to be a scary world, maybe his point was that the world is a scary place, and thus well-suited for a politician like him, who traffics in fear.Then there is the domestic side. Trump brings up his Uncle John on subjects that have nothing to do with technology, such as when the Washington Post asked him about his tendency to use crude language and insult people. Trump said that that wouldnt continue when he was Presidentand why not? My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at M.I.T. for thirty-five years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else, Dr. John Trumpa great guy. That was followed not by a quote from his uncle about, say, the importance of treating people decently, but by the simple statement: Im an intelligent person. This is the professors other role in the Trump rhetorical universe: as a sort of eugenic guarantor of intelligence and breeding.It is a theme that comes up often. I had a father who was successful, Trump told CNN, in 2010. And, you know, I have a certain gene. Im a gene believer. Hey, when you connect two race horses, you usually end up with a fast horse. In South Carolina, earlier this year, he noted, Dr. John Trump at M.I.T.; good genes, very good genes, O.K., very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart. (Donald Trump was at Wharton as an undergraduate, after transferring from Fordham.) To the Boston Globe: My fathers brother was a brilliant man . . . We have very good genetics. And then on NBC, after telling Lester Holt that his uncle was a professor at M.I.T.: I mean its a good gene pool right therehe pointed to his headI have to do what I have to do.Looking at Trumps ideological assemblage, one can see certain common connectorsfatalism, fear, and a social-Darwinists contempt for those who dont do quite as well as he and his family have. Being born rich isnt luck; its something to congratulate oneself on when one looks in the mirror. The opposite is true of the losers. Its part of what can make Trump feel both like a doomsayer and a smug child. In his rallies, he has taken to giving dramatic readings of the lyrics of a song, by Al Wilson, called The Snake, which he presents as a parable about the dangers of immigration: a woman saw a beautiful snake at the side of the road, almost dead from the cold. She took it home, warmed it up, saved its life, and clutched it to her bosomTrump always emphasizes that phrasewhereupon it bit her. As she died from the venom, she asked why. You knew damn well I was a snake! Trump shouts. The world is scary; people dont change. All a Trump can do is ride down an escalator to the lobby in Trump Tower, past the gold fittings and the waterfall, and say that hes running for President. Then come the sparks.",Donald Trumps Nuclear Uncle,,Amy Davidson Sorkin,context,irrelevant,context,,275,

To some of the few who did, the meetings could trigger politically damaging comparisons to Nancy Reagan's use of astrology,"" Woodward wrote.Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Lisa Caputo, is quoted in the Sun-Times as saying the first lady's interest in Houston is no secret.Woodward says anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, daughter of famed anthropologist Margaret Mead, joined her in sessions of imaginary conversations.Woodward is an assistant managing editor at The Washington Post. As a reporter, he helped break the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein.Mrs. Clinton herself wrote about her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt in her June 10 column. She said she talked to Roosevelt about the role of a first lady.""She usually responds by telling me to buck up, or at least to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros,"" Mrs. Clinton wrote.In the column, she described Houston as an expert on philosophy and mythology. ""(Houston) has shared her views with me on everything from the ancient Greeks to the lives of women and children on Bangladesh,"" she wrote.Mrs. Clinton also acknowledged her relationship with Bateson.""She and I have spent hours discussing the ways in which women in different societies attempt to fulfill their responsibilities to their families, jobs and communities,"" Mrs. Clinton wrote.Related stories:",Book says Hillary talks to dead,,,right,context,context,,279,

But you may want to think twice before you gift-wrap one and slide it under the Christmas tree.It turns out the electronic self-balancing scooters are not just figuratively hot. Several consumers have reported that their hoverboards have suddenly burst into flames.The Consumer Product Safety Commission is investigating the hoverboard-related fires across the United States, including testing new and fire-damaged boards.Every consumer who is riding a hoverboard, who purchased one to give as a gift during the holidays, or who is thinking about buying one deserves to know if there is a safety defect, Elliot Kaye, chairman of the CPSC, said in a statement.One probable cause is overheating by the boards lithium ion batteries. Faulty cables, plugs and chargers may also create a fire risk.Hoverboards have been banned by Americas biggest airlines, including American, Delta, Southwest and United, because of fire concerns. The United States Postal Service also announced that boards with lithium batteries could no longer be shipped by air.Effective immediately and until further notice, USPS will ship hoverboards using only Standard Post/Parcel Select. This product travels on ground transportation, due to the potential safety hazards of lithium batteries.Amazon briefly yanked nearly all its hoverboard listings citing fire concerns, but many of the boards are now back on sale, CBS reports.Amazon and other retailers are now demanding  and touting  that the hoverboards they sell have Underwriters Laboratories-approved battery chargers, yanking some but keeping many models available during the height of the Christmas shopping season, CBS said.Amazon recently sent emails to many of its U.K. customers who purchased hoverboards, notifying them that their boards plugs dont meet safety standards and urging them to throw out or recycle the boards, CNN Money reports. Amazon promised those customers a full refund.We regret the inconvenience this may cause you but trust you will understand that your safety and satisfaction is our highest priority, Amazon explained in the email.Though some hoverboards have the UL mark on the board or the items box, the certification may not refer to the board, but to the battery charger.We have certified many varieties of battery chargers, John Drengenberg, an electrical engineer and ULs consumer safety director, told CBS. That in no way says anything about a hoverboard being approved.Yikes.

In recent years, some residents have called them angels in orange.Its a real good experience. Its better than sitting (in the prison) yard. I like getting in there and helping people, one 33-year-old inmate, Deshan Heard, told the OC Register this week. Heard, of Los Angeles, is serving six years behind bars for robbery.Heard is assigned to one of 43 conservation camps across the state, a network of prison-funded fire companies from the borders of Oregon to Mexico. The convict crew, run by the California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation and in part by Cal Fire or the Los Angeles Fire Department, has roughly 3,800 to 4,000 inmates a week.About 200 of those inmates are women, battling a rash of infernos that are the deadliest California has ever seen. The fires have claimed the lives of 31 people as of Thursday night and left at least 400 people missing.On Monday, a day after the blazes started, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for swaths of Northern Californias wine country, including Napa and Sonoma counties. The fires wiped out entire neighborhoods in Santa Rosa, decimating about 2,834 homes and 400,000 square feet of commercial space.Given this devastation, We need every firefighter we can get, whether its an inmate or not, said corrections spokesman Bill Sessa.One firefighter, Sandra Welsh, told NBC News recently, We are the ones that do the line. We are the ones that carry the hose out. Were the line of defense. Welshs Malibu camp was on standby as firefighters battle a brush fire in Anaheim Hills. Women make up three of the programs conservation camps, Sessa said.As of Friday morning, about 235 jailbirds turned firefighters were assigned to Canyon Fire 2 in Anaheim Hills, Sessa said. Meanwhile, roughly 300 were assigned to hot spots in Sonoma, Solano, and Napa counties.Today alone we have 1,700 inmates (or about 16 crews) on a fire line somewhere, Sessa said, adding, We are not only fighting fires, but we also have to provide backup fire protection in parts of the state that are not burning.During these massive fires, its common for inmate crews to work 24 straight hours, followed by a day of rest. The inmates, wearing orange jumpsuits, put in the same hours as their civilian brethren in yellow suits. (The professionals make a minimum of $17.70 an hour, according to one AFP report.)Get The Beast In Your Inbox! Daily Digest Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.

Like civilians, the inmates work in rough terrain, carrying hand tools and 60 pounds of gear on their backs.We tell all the guys we pick: We will treat you like a firefighter. We will only treat you like an inmate if you make us do it, Sessa told The Daily Beast. That happens very rarely. Most inmates in these camps have earned the right to be chosen based on rehabilitation work while they are serving their sentence in regular prison.The program, which started in the 1940s, is constantly replenishing its ranks because the inmates complete their sentences or are paroled. Sessa stresses that placement in the fire crews is voluntary.But last month, a candidate for lieutenant governor called the program slave labor and abuse on her website.No matter how you may want to dress it up, if you have people working for nothing or almost nothing, youve got slave labor, and it is not acceptable, wrote Gayle McLaughlin, a former mayor of Richmond, California.In response to such criticism, Sessa told The Daily Beast that people make slave labor claims because theyre looking from the outside in.On occasion you have a fringe candidate for elective office who thinks its a great sound byte to stick in a headline, but if you look at it from the inmates perspective, its difficult to call them enslaved when theyre volunteering to do the job, Sessa said.Every inmate working in a fire camp raised their hand and volunteered to do it, he added.Sessa said the $1-an-hour for fire prevention is the highest paying job for a California inmate and has rehabilitative value. Some inmates, he said, have never even held a job before joining the firefighting program.When the inmates arent on call, they earn $2 a day while at the camp.If theyre raising their hand and volunteering to do it and getting $76,000 a year in benefits before they ever go to camp, then this whole argument about enslavement makes no sense, Sessa said, referring to what he said was the prison systems annual cost to house an inmate.Sessa estimated the state of California is saving taxpayers $90 million to $100 million a year through the program.These inmates are not necessarily confined to fighting fires where they camp, Sessa said. Quite often they move hundreds of miles in a day, depending on where theyre needed.All of these inmates can be moved in a moment, he said, adding that crews from San Diego are working in Sonoma. They move constantly.The firefighters work in crews of 14 people. They live in supervised fire camps when theyre not in the field. When theyre not on a fire, they usually work on fire prevention or conservation projects, such as cutting brush or taking out a grove of diseased trees.While TV footage shows civilian firefighters in airplanes or water trucks, the inmates have a different role: They cut fire breaks by handor clear stretches of landto stop the spread of flames, Sessa said.When you hear on the news that a fire is X percent contained, that is in some part from what our crews do, Sessa said.The inmates use hand tools, with a lead firefighter using a chainsaw to cut trees and others using axes and shovels. Every person in line has a job related to the person behind them in line, Sessa added.Still, the work is not without danger. This year, two inmates died in the line of fire.Matthew Beck, 26, died in May when a 120-foot tree uprooted and crushed him in Humboldt County, about 300 miles north of San Francisco. Beck was serving six years for a 2014 burglary in Los Angeles County.In July, Frank Anaya was killed in San Diego after he slashed his leg with a chainsaw. The 22-year-old died after undergoing several surgeries. Anaya, of Ventura County, was serving a three-year sentence for spousal assault and weapons offenses.Anayas fatal injury marked the fifth death in the programs 40-year history. When you consider the decades this has been in place, the safety record has been outstanding, Sessa said when asked about those who lost their lives.A debate has long swirled around the program.As The Daily Beast previously reported, the California attorney generals office argued against an early prison-release program in 2014 because they believed it would severely impact fire camp participation.In response, David Fathi, director of the ACLUs National Prison Project, said such dangerous work outside of prison walls had a risk of government abuse. The inmate firefighters may also not be aware of the long-term health risks, he said.Yet in the press, the prisoners themselves are praising their roles.This is the first time in a long time my family is proud of me, Travis Reeder, a 23-year-old imprisoned for drug dealing, recently told AFP.In 2015, one firefighting convict said he volunteered for the program because the conservation camp gave him freedom.Then-34-year-old Joshua Coover told the East Bay Times that working all night to clear hazardous vegetation was the best feeling in the world.The best feeling is when we get off the fire; all the signs you see that say thank you, firefighters,' Coover told the Times.

The South Carolina representative has been chairing the investigative committee and intentionally dragged out his hearings until they bled into this years presidential race. But this time, Gowdy really screwed up.Gowdy finally admitted that his Benghazi committee is fake in an interview with Fox News Bill Hemmer. The committees lead investigative attorney, retired three-star Army Lt. Gen. Dana Chipman, who repeatedly commended the militarys actions on the night of the attacks during closed interviews with Defense Department officials has even quit, saying that nothing more can be done.The committee chair has led the two-year-old investigation, which has been fraught with rudeness and heated arguments among the members. The last time it met publicly was in October 2015, which puts another nail in the charges against Gowdy.The question central to the various Benghazi investigations is whether President Obama or Clinton issued a stand down order. Everything the committee has done was built upon that premise. Republicans have long held that the military had been ordered to stand down rather than respond to calls for help from U.S. people under attack.The panel formed in May 2014, and when it last met, Clinton testified for 11 hours. Democrats blame the Republicans for delaying the panels final report to interfere with Clintons presidential race. Republicans blame President Obama for stalling by withholding documents and interview subjects.Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs Stephen C. Hedger wrote a letter to Gowdy on April 28 where he expressed frustration with the panel for its crescendo of expensive, duplicate, and unnecessary requests, and claims based on Facebook or talk radio.General Jerry Boykin had this to say when he was working to form the Benghazi committee in 2013:I know Allen has been very concerned as I have been as to why there was no military response. No ones ever given a satisfactory answer. And as I said to the speaker last night, theres an American value, an American ethos that was violated and it is very important not only to the families but it is very important to every soldier, sailor and Marine or diplomat thats put in harms way in the future. So I think well see some things that will come out today that will begin to whittle away at our big question of why no military response.During Hemmers interview with Gowdy, the chairman of the committee said:Whether or not they could have gotten there in time, they couldnt. I dont think theres any question about that.Wait a minute! That was the entire premise for the Benghazi hearings! That means it didnt matter whether or not Clinton or President Obama ordered the military to stand down.Now, according to Crooks and Liars, Gowdy is trying to repair the huge hole this has torn in his investigation:Why could you not? Why were you not positioned to do it?Nice try, Gowdy, but no cigar. The question now is whether Gowdy will be able to persevere with his committee now that he has destroyed his very reason for its existence.To learn more about what Gowdy is like, check out this video of him complaining about the Obama administration:_LINKS_Featured Image: Donkey Hotey via Flickr, Creative Commons License.H/T: Crooks And Liars.",JUST IN: Rep.

So I had a quick trim with a new razor.'But over the weekend, I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding. I didn't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving.'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life.'Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal began in May 2012. Two days after she'd shaved, she began experiencing dizziness and nausea.She visited her GP, who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection.Later that day, her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed, with her legs covered in a bloody red rash.Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from the rotting flesh (pictured in September 2012 after a couple of skin graft procedures to repair some of the damage on her legs)Afterwards, her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination.But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery, she collapsed. Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor  Dana Sedgewick, 44An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis.The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch.Mrs Sedgewick said: 'By the time I got to the hospital, my legs were covered in black, rotting flesh. It was touch-and-go as to whether I'd make it.'Over the next ten hours, surgeons battled to save her legs. Cutting through seven inches of infected skin, they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back.Rushed to intensive care, doctors placed her in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times (pictured at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield in May 2012)Having managed to come round from the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again (pictured in hospital suffering from the infection)The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch (pictured: her legs now after having the operations to repair the damage that was caused)Doctors told Mrs Sedgewick that she had been very lucky to survive her terrifying ordeal with necrotising fasciitis (pictured in hospital in June 2012)During surgery, she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock.The silent killer strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs.To increase her chances of survival, doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days.She said: 'When I woke up, my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened. I thought I'd been in a car accident.'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving, I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line.'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected, and I'd been very lucky to survive.'Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time.She said: 'It was horrific. All of my muscle had rotted away, and I had a crater of skin near my groin. I felt like I was going to throw up.'But I knew that it could have been much, much worse. I could easily have lost my legs - or worse, died.'Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time (pictured in hospital in June 2012)But with the support of her husband, Mathew, 47, she has now recovered and is back at home with her children - Megan, 18, Freya, 14, and Klara, nine (the family are pictured before Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal on a day out to Endcliffe Park, Sheffield, on Christmas Day 2016)WHAT IS NECROTISING FASCIITIS? Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus. Those infections normally last just a few days - they are mild and typically clear themselves up. But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death. .Doctors warned that she'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches, after intense physiotherapy.Six weeks later, she was discharged from hospital.Over the next four years, she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin.Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.'But with Mat's support, I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I'd been, and how lucky I was to survive.'It's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me. I had a very close shave indeed.'Dr Ron Daniels BEM, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: 'Stories like Dana's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do. Every day in the UK, individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition.'But through better awareness, thousands of lives could be saved each year.'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis, it's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient.'Anyone with flu-like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately. With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered, the risk of death increases.'Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.

But it all started with his starring role in Rocky IV, as the menacing Soviet boxer Ivan Drago.As he tells NPR's Arun Rath, it was the role that changed his life. And he wouldn't have gotten to that silver-screen spotlight if he hadn't taken a gig as a bouncer  and stumbled upon romance.Enlarge this image toggle caption Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty ImagesA Childhood In Sweden, And Dreams Of AmericaThe movie star ""Dolph"" Lundgren was actually born Hans Lundgren. (He took on the name Dolph, a relative's name from his mother's side of the family, with the release of the Rocky film in 1985.) He grew up largely in and around Stockholm, and excelled in school from an early age.""I had some allergies when I was younger,"" Lundgren says, and, as a result, ""I wasn't very good at sports. So my kind of way to feel like I was somebody was to answer all the questions the teacher asked.""From early on, Lundgren also dreamed of going to the United States, but, he says, his family couldn't afford to send him: ""So the way to get there for me was to get academic scholarships.""Lundgren's aptitude for chemical engineering propelled him to scholarships around the world. There was Washington State University, Clemson University, Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, the University of Sydney in Australia and, ultimately, a competitive Fulbright scholarship to attend MIT.But that was all before Lundgren met Grace Jones.A Taste Of Show BusinessWhile in Australia, Lundgren, then a competitive martial artist, got a job as a bouncer through a friend of a friend. That meant he provided security at concerts for artists like Joan Armatrading, Dr. Hook and Grace Jones.""I was assigned to [Jones'] dressing room,"" Lundgren recalls. ""I think she spotted me out there. And I was just a Swedish kid, I didn't know anything. And I think she kind of liked me.""A night of partying after Jones' show led to a four-year romance and a major course correction on Lundgren's trajectory toward MIT.""She changed it big time,"" Lundgren says.Jones  who was famous not just for her music, but also for her acting and modeling  took Lundgren to New York, where they partied at the legendary Studio 54 and Andy Warhol took pictures of Lundgren. Jones introduced Lundgren to the world of show business.Meanwhile, Lundgren was still set to begin his Fulbright scholarship at MIT.""I started sort of thinking, 'Wow, this is kind of cool,' "" Lundgren remembers: "" 'I don't know if I want to go back to engineering after this.'

JEREMY HUTCHINSON: On lawyer suspension list.On March 8, the Supreme Court suspended the license offor nonpayment of dues. I've sent him a note asking whether he's cleared the matter up. Hutchinson has been practicing law periodically, including for clients he subsequently helped, coincidentally, with legislation. Not that advocating a former client's interest in the Senate is practicing law (though some might find it unseemly). Hutchinson, with a rambunctious former girlfriend who improperly received some of his campaign cash and a losing legal battle over debts owed a campaign consultant, has had a series of personal problems. More fodder for, who has said she'll run against Hutchinson for Senate next year.I wonder: Could Hutchinson take referral work from Texarkana plaintiffs' lawyer John Goodson during a suspension? I don't mean to count as legal work being Goodson's highly valuable advocate for a tort reform proposal that sabotaged the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce's march to a tough tort reform proposal.On the subject of lawyer dues: Reader Radical Centrist noted on the open line last night that former President Bill Clinton also turned up on the list of Arkansas lawyers suspended March 8 for non-payment of bar dues. The Arkansas Supreme Court record doesn't indicate if he's cleared up the matter and I've sent a query about it. It's not very important. He hasn't been practicing law, being busy with a few other things. He served a five-year suspension that ended in 2006 over testimony he gave in the Whitewater investigations when he became eligible for reinstatement.UPDATE: Dues are payable between Jan. 1 and March 1 each year. Each attorney gets a letter in December as a reminder. If they are not paid, a computer program automatically suspends a license. Judges in the state got the list yesterday of those suspended, which explains the news coming out yesterday. There were about 700 on the list. Renewal requires only payment of dues and a late fee. A spokesman in the Supreme Court clerk's office said Sen. Hutchinson paid his fee this morning and the website will be updated this evening to show he's in good standing. The annual dues are $200 and the late fee is $100.As for Bill Clinton: He never applied for reinstatement of his law license after his five-year suspension and hasn't paid dues since 2000. But his name automatically turns up on the list each year regardless. The list of 700 typically includes the names of many lawyers no longer practicing or dead.A lawyer who practices after a suspension takes effect is practicing without a license. That can potentially have consequences for a client. For example, an attorney might file a pleading in a criminal or civil case that could be held invalid because it wasn't filed by a licensed lawyer. A refiling could come after a statute of limitation had tolled.","UPDATE: Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, Bill Clinton on lawyer suspension list",5/17/13,Max Brantley,context,context,n,,286,

Browner[EPA speech - June 8, 2000]Today, the Clinton-Gore Administration is announcing a major step to improve safety for all Americans from the health risks posed by pesticides. We are eliminating virtually all home and garden uses of Dursban -- the most widely used household pesticide in the United States.This action comes after completing the most extensive scientific review of the potential hazards from a pesticide ever conducted. This action -- the result of an agreement with the manufacturers -- will significantly minimize potential health risks from exposure to Dursban, also called chlorpyrifos, for all Americans, especially children.This action is good news for the protection of our country's public health. It is good news for the environment. And it is particularly good news for children, who are among the most vulnerable to the risks posed by pesticides.In 1993, the Clinton-Gore Administration went to Congress with a plan -- based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences -- to better protect our families from the risks of pesticides by making children's health the benchmark for safety. We did this because children are not just small adults. Their bodies are still developing and more susceptible to risks from toxic chemicals. They play on floors and in yards where pesticides have been applied. And they eat proportionately more food with respect to body weight than do adults. When our health and safety standards protect children, the entire public is protected.Three years after Congress received this plan from the Clinton-Gore Administration, it unanimously passed the Food Quality Protection Act. President Clinton signed it into law in 1996. Last summer EPA took the first actions under the new law against two pesticides that posed the greatest threats to children at that time: methyl parathion and azinphos methyl. Today we are taking action against chlorpyrifos -- the most commonly used pesticide in homes, buildings and schools.Dursban is the common trade name, but it is one product of more than 800 containing the chemical chlorpyrifos, which today's action affects. Chlorpyrifos is commonly found in many home-and-garden bug sprays. It is used in some treatments of termites. And it is used on some agricultural crops. It belongs to a family of older, riskier pesticides called organophosphates, some of which date back 50 years or more. The time has come to review these pesticides for safety, and, where the science dictates, remove those chemicals that pose an unreasonable threat to human health and move to newer, safer alternatives. That is what we are doing today.With today's announcement, we are taking the fastest action possible for removing these household products from the market: This action:will virtually eliminate home, lawn and garden uses by the end of the year.It will virtually eliminate all termite-control uses in existing homes by the end of the year.It will eliminate this year the use of chlorpyrifos for all sensitive areas, such as schools, day cares, parks, hospitals, nursing homes and malls by the end of the year.It will eliminate or dramatically lower pesticide residues on several foods by next growing season.And, finally, it will eliminate the use of chlorpyrifos as a termiticide for new home-and-building construction by the end of 2004.I am pleased that the major manufacturers, Dow AgroSciences and others, have entered into this agreement to ensure that the risk reductions we are seeking will begin as quickly as possible.Today's action is part of an overall commitment by the Clinton-Gore Administration to protect public health and the environment that begins with our children. The protection of children has guided the actions we've taken for cleaner air to breathe. The protection of children has guided the actions we've taken for safer drinking water. And the protection of children has guided the actions we are taking for safer pesticide use. Today's action represents another significant step in safeguarding the health of our children, and therefore the health of all Americans.",Dursban Announcement,6/25/13,,irrelevant,context,context,,288,

I dont think any administration has had a worse day since boxers and briefs on MTV. And the truth is that Colin Powell had an opportunity here to reaffirm this presidents commitment to abstinence as the best choice for our young people, and he chose not to do that in the first instance, but  and so I think its very sad. The other part is that, frankly, condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases, and in that sense, Wolf, this was  the secretary of state may be inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives.Pence then went on to suggest that condoms are too modern, and too liberal, for him:The problem is it was too modern of an answer, Wolf. It was  it truly was a modern, liberal answer to a problem that parents like me are facing all over America, and frankly, all over the world.Of course Pence is wrong. His claim that condoms are a very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases is easy to debunk. The CDC reports:when used consistently and correctly, condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection and reduce the risk of other STDs.As for condoms being too modern, reports indicate many ancient cultures used some form of condoms, and a famous cave painting in Dordogne, France, shows a man practicing safe sex circa 11,000 B.C.In more contemporary times, rubber replaced animal intestines in condoms around the mid 1800s, and latex replaced rubber in the 1920s.Needless to say, there is nothing modern about condoms.Bottom line: Pence is an ignorant and dangerous religious extremist. By disseminating false and misleading information about condoms, Pence demonstrates that he is willing to endanger the health and welfare of young people in order to promote his demented, right-wing, conservative Christian, puritanical agenda.",Mike Pence: Condoms Are Too Modern,2008-11-16,Progressive Secular Humanist,right,right,n,,291,

REUTERS/Larry DowningObama, during talks in Seoul, urged Moscow to give him space until after the November ballot, and Medvedev said he would relay the message to incoming Russian president Vladimir Putin.The unusually frank exchange came as Obama and Medvedev huddled together on the eve of a global nuclear security summit in the South Korean capital, unaware their words were being picked up by microphones as reporters were led into the room.U.S. plans for an anti-missile shield have bedeviled relations between Washington and Moscow despite Obamas reset in ties between the former Cold War foes. Obamas Republican opponents have accused him of being too open to concessions to Russia on the issue.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney seized on Obamas comment, calling it alarming and troubling.This is no time for our president to be pulling his punches with the American people, Romney said in a campaign speech in San Diego.As he was leaning toward Medvedev in Seoul, Obama was overheard asking for time - particularly with missile defense - until he is in a better position politically to resolve such issues.I understand your message about space, replied Medvedev, who will hand over the presidency to Putin in May.This is my last election ... After my election I have more flexibility, Obama said, expressing confidence that he would win a second term.I will transmit this information to Vladimir, said Medvedev, Putins protg and long considered number two in Moscows power structure.The exchange, parts of it inaudible, was monitored by a White House pool of television journalists as well as Russian reporters listening live from their press center.The United States and NATO have offered Russia a role in the project to create an anti-ballistic shield which includes participation by Romania, Poland, Turkey and Spain.But Moscow says it fears the system could weaken Russia by gaining the capability to shoot down the nuclear missiles it relies on as a deterrent.It wants a legally binding pledge from the United States that Russias nuclear forces would not be targeted by the system and joint control of how it is used.The White House, initially caught off-guard by questions about the leaders exchange, later released a statement recommitting to implementing missile defense which weve repeatedly said is not aimed at Russia but also acknowledging election-year obstacles on the issue.Since 2012 is an election year in both countries, with an election and leadership transition in Russia and an election in the United States, it is clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said.Therefore, President Obama and President Medvedev agreed that it was best to instruct our technical experts to do the work of better understanding our respective positions, providing space for continued discussions on missile defense cooperation going forward, he said.",Obama tells Russia's Medvedev more flexibility after election,3/26/12,Reuters Editorial,right,right,n,,294,

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), many of his supporters have taken to posting a black-and-white photo of the presidential candidate from 1962. Students can be seen sitting on the floor and standing in the back as the then-dark-haired activist addresses them.The compelling picture can be found in the senators biographical video on his campaign website. At the University of Chicago, Sanders says as the photo fades in and out, I got involved in the civil rights movement. We ended up engaging in a sit-in demonstration. Its on the campaigns Tumblr feed. As the Civil Rights Movement grew, Bernie led a sit-in to desegregate off-campus housing at the University of Chicago, reads the timeline under 1962. And Sanders used it in a stirring 2013 video to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. I remember the day very well and I remember the moment, the period well, he says as the photo passes by, because up at the University of Chicago, where I was then going to school, we were working with young people in the South.Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders recalls his personal history with activism in a campaign video. (Bernie 2016)But thats not Bernie Sanders in the photo. It is Bruce Rappaport.Classmates of the two men started raising concerns about the discrepancy last year. According to Time, four University of Chicago alumni told the magazine in November that they believed the man to be Rappaport, also a student activist, who died in 2006. At the time of the story, the photo was still captioned as Bernie Sanders in the University of Chicagos photo archive. But the pictures caption has since been changed.Alumni who knew them well said that was Bruce Rappaport [pictured], a University of Chicago official told me Wednesday. The caption was changed in January. This was just a case of honest misattribution, the official told me.When Time asked Sanders campaign strategist Tad Devine about the photo discrepancy last year, he said, This is the first weve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think thats Bernie. But well take a look at it. Three months later, here is what Devine told me when I asked him about the discrepancy and whether the campaign planned to remove the photo from the Tumblr feed or the campaign video:When I originally used this photo back in May/June is was because the U of Chicago had identified the guy standing as Bernie. It certainly looked like him, and Bernie remembers being there as part of the protests. Then Time Magazine months later raised a question about whether that was him standing. To be honest we are not 100% sure if it is or not. As to why we would leave it in the video, I think it is an accurate representative scene of something that he was part of at the time, so I did not think I needed to redo the video we made months ago. There is no dispute he was there and part of these protests, just like there is no dispute that he was at the March on Washington, where we again used representative visual images.Sanderss supporters have been posting that picture everywhere to imply that he was in the trenches fighting for the rights of African Americans when rival Hillary Clinton was a Republican-supporting Goldwater Girl. Never mind she backed Democrats in the subsequent presidential elections. Or that her civil rights bona fides go back to 1972, when she investigated school discrimination in Dothan, Ala., for the Childrens Defense Fund.Bernie Sanders (standing, right), member of the Committee on Racial Equalitys steering committee, stands next to University of Chicago President George Beadle, who addresses a CORE meeting on housing sit-ins. (Danny Lyon/Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library)Sanderss involvement in the civil rights movement and his commitment to equal justice are not in question. Another old picture that appears in campaign literature and video of student-activist Sanders with the university president is not in question. That most definitely is him. Whats at issue is Sanderss misleading use of a photograph to burnish already solid credentials. For a candidate who garnered 92 percent of New Hampshire Democratic voters who said the most important trait for a candidate was that he or she be honest, the least his campaign could do is remove that photo from its Tumblr feed and stop physically placing him where he existed only in spirit.Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj",Stop sending around this photo of Bernie Sanders,2002-11-16,Jonathan Capehart,right,right,n,,295,

Matthew made one official U.S. landfall on Oct. 8 southeast of McClellanville, South Carolina, as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph winds.<img class=""styles__noscript__2rw2y"" src=""_LINKS_ srcset=""_LINKS_ 400w, _LINKS_ 800w"" > Satellite, radar, and statistics on Hurricane Matthew's landfall on October 8, 2016.Matthew was declared post-tropical by the National Hurricane Center as it moved away from North Carolina on Oct. 9.Matthew's U.S. Storm ReportsStorm SurgeOn Oct. 7 in Florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at an NOS tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, Florida.Storm surge flooding affected the St. Augustine area, including major flooding on Anastasia Island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. To the south in nearby Flagler Beach, Florida, parts of A1A were washed out by the storm surge.The NWS-Jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between Marineland and Matanzas Inlet, between Palm Coast and St. Augustine Beach, Florida .The St. Johns River in northeast Florida reached its highest level on record at Shands Bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the Racy Point, Red Bay Point and I-295 bridge tide gauges. Early in the morning on Oct. 8, the St. Johns River was flowing backwards.Matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, early Oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of Charleston, South Carolina.A storm surge of just under 8 feet was recorded at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, between Savannah and Tybee Island, according to NOAA/National Ocean Service data. Fort Pulaski set a new record tide level of 12.57 ft MLLW (above normal low tide), which occurred two hours after high tide. This beats the old record going back to Hurricane David in 1979.Tide levels at the Charleston Harbor peaked at their third highest level on record with the morning high tide on Oct. 8, the highest levels, there, since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and over a foot higher than the early October 2015 flood event. Water was entering homes on West Ashley in Charleston, according to the National Weather Service.On the afternoon of Oct. 8, water levels were topping 5 feet above normal at Oyster Landing, near Georgetown, South Carolina, and at Myrtle Beach. In southern North Carolina, water levels on the Cape Fear River at Wilmington shattered a record from Hurricane Hazel in 1954 .The Springmaid Pier in Myrtle Beach was heavily damaged, a section of the Oak Island (North Carolina) pier was also also damaged by waves , and the Jacksonville Beach pier was also damaged .On the morning of Oct. 9, major sound side storm surge flooding affected the Outer Banks of North Carolina.Wind ReportsHere are some of the top wind gust reports from Matthew:Cape Canaveral, Florida: 107 mph (on an elevated tower at 54 feet above the ground)Tybee Island, Georgia: 96 mphJennette's Pier, North Carolina (Outer Banks): 91 mphDaytona Beach, Florida: 91 mphHilton Head Island, South Carolina: 88 mphJacksonville Area: 87 mphSouth Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida: 84 mphDuck, North Carolina: 83 mphBeaufort, South Carolina: 83 mphFort Pulaski, Georgia: 79 mphFolly Beach, South Carolina: 76 mphOceana NAS, Virginia: 75 mphMyrtle Beach, South Carolina: 74 mphSavannah, Georgia: 71 mphMelbourne, Florida: 70 mphCharleston, South Carolina: 69 mphFlorence, South Carolina: 67 mphLumbertgon, North Carolina: 66 mphFayetteville, North Carolina: 62 mphSumter, South Carolina: 61 mphOrlando Area: Gusts over 60 mph<img class=""styles__noscript__2rw2y"" src=""_LINKS_ srcset=""_LINKS_ 400w, _LINKS_ 800w"" >Interestingly, some of the strongest wind gusts in the Carolinas occurred after the center of Matthew passed by.Rainfall ReportsFayetteville, North Carolina, picked up over 8 inches of rain in 6 hours on the morning of Oct. 8 and totaled over 14 inches of rain from this event.

On Wednesday, a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church said that separating mothers from their babies was ""immoral.""Sessions said many of the recent criticisms were not ""fair or logical and some are contrary to law.""""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,"" he said. ""Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful.""Last month, the attorney general announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy that any adult who enters the country illegally is criminally prosecuted. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are.According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, more than 650 children were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border during a two-week period in May.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that she hadn't seen Sessions' comments but affirmed that the Bible did back up the administration's actions.""I can say that it is very biblical to enforce the law. That is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible,"" she said. ""It's a moral policy to follow and enforce the law.""In an unusually tense series of exchanges in the White House briefing room, Sanders wrongly blamed Democrats for the policy separating children from parents and insisted the administration had made no changes in increasing the use. Until the policy was announced in April, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.""The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close, and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade, and the president is simply enforcing them,"" she said.""We don't want this to be a problem,"" she said.Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, the archbishop of Galveston-Houston, told the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Wednesday that he was joining other religious leaders in opposing the government's border policy.""Our government has the discretion in our laws to ensure that young children are not separated from their parents and exposed to irreparable harm and trauma,"" DiNardo said in a statement.___Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",Sessions cites Bible to defend separating immigrant families,,,context,context,n,,297,

Thank you. I love you all. Youll have to forgive me. Ive lost my voice in screaming and lamentation this weekend. And I have lost my mind sometime earlier this year, so I have to read.Thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press. Just to pick up on what Hugh Laurie said: You and all of us in this room really belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now. Think about it: Hollywood, foreigners and the press.But who are we, and what is Hollywood anyway? Its just a bunch of people from other places. I was born and raised and educated in the public schools of New Jersey. Viola was born in a sharecroppers cabin in South Carolina, came up in Central Falls, Rhode Island; Sarah Paulson was born in Florida, raised by a single mom in Brooklyn. Sarah Jessica Parker was one of seven or eight kids in Ohio. Amy Adams was born in Vicenza, Italy. And Natalie Portman was born in Jerusalem. Where are their birth certificates? And the beautiful Ruth Negga was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, raised in London  no, in Ireland I do believe, and shes here nominated for playing a girl in small-town Virginia.Ryan Gosling, like all of the nicest people, is Canadian, and Dev Patel was born in Kenya, raised in London, and is here playing an Indian raised in Tasmania. So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick them all out youll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.They gave me three seconds to say this, so: An actors only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us, and let you feel what that feels like. And there were many, many, many powerful performances this year that did exactly that. Breathtaking, compassionate work.But there was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good; there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still cant get it out of my head, because it wasnt in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when its modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybodys life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. O.K., go on with it.O.K., this brings me to the press. We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage. Thats why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in the Constitution. So I only ask the famously well-heeled Hollywood Foreign Press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists, because were gonna need them going forward, and theyll need us to safeguard the truth.One more thing: Once, when I was standing around on the set one day, whining about something  you know we were gonna work through supper or the long hours or whatever, Tommy Lee Jones said to me, Isnt it such a privilege, Meryl, just to be an actor? Yeah, it is, and we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy. We should all be proud of the work Hollywood honors here tonight.As my friend, the dear departed Princess Leia, said to me once, take your broken heart, make it into art.",Meryl Streeps Golden Globes Speech,2001-08-17,,right,context,context,,299,

Allen.,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-tbw-ceo-sentenced-40-months-prison-fraud-scheme,2,TRUE,No Error,"WASHINGTON  The former chief executive officer  of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker (TBW) was sentenced today to 40 months in prison for his role in a more than $2.9 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the failure of TBW. At one time, TBW was one of the largest privately held mortgage lending companies in the United States.Paul Allen was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia. The sentence was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride for the Eastern District of Virginia; Acting Special Inspector General Christy Romero for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); Assistant Director in Charge James W. McJunkin of the FBIs Washington Field Office; Michael P. Stephens, Deputy Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD-OIG); Jon T. Rymer, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC-OIG); Steve A. Linick, Inspector General of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA-OIG); and Victor S. O. Song, Chief of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).Allen, 55, of Oakton, Va., pleaded guilty in April 2011 to one count of making false statements and one count of conspiring to commit bank and wire fraud. Co-conspirator Sean Ragland, a former senior financial analyst at TBW who reported to Allen, was also sentenced today by Judge Brinkema to three months in prison. Ragland, 37, of San Antonio, pleaded guilty in March 2011 to one count of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. Allen and Ragland both admitted to conspiring with Lee Bentley Farkas, the former chairman of TBW, and others, to defraud financial institutions that had invested in Ocala Funding LLC, a facility wholly-owned by TBW.Farkas was convicted on April 19, 2011, on 14 counts of fraud for his role in masterminding the scheme, which was one of the largest bank frauds in the country. Farkas is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27, 2011. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a civil action pending against Farkas in the Eastern District of Virginia.Co-conspirators Catherine Kissick, a former senior vice president of Colonial Bank and head of its Mortgage Warehouse Lending Division (MWLD); Teresa Kelly, a former operations supervisor in Colonial Banks MWLD; Raymond Bowman, the former president of TBW; and Desiree Brown, the former treasurer of TBW, have also pleaded guilty for their participation in the scheme. Earlier this month, Kissick was sentenced to eight years in prison, Brown was sentenced to six years in prison, Bowman was sentenced 30 months in prison and Kelly was sentenced to 3 months in prison.As TBWs chief executive officer, Mr. Allen served as an accomplice to Lee Farkas and his massive fraud scheme, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. He concealed TBWs staggering deficits through false financial reports, which ultimately caused investors to lose more than $1.5 billion. Todays sentence sends a strong message that corporate fraud by senior executives will not be tolerated. At the same time, it demonstrates that substantial assistance in the governments investigation and prosecution of corporate fraud will be taken into account at sentencing.Paul Allen was a well-respected mortgage executive hired by Lee Farkas to be TBWs chief executive officer. Working from Oakton, Va., Mr. Allen led Ocala Funding, a TBW multi-billion dollar lending facility that was used to defraud investors of more than $1 billion, said U.S. Attorney MacBride. Mr. Allens sentence reflects his ultimate cooperation with this investigation, but also sends the message that unless executives expose and stop fraud when they first learn of it, they will be punished.According to court documents and information presented at trial, Allen and Ragland participated in the scheme from early 2005 through August 2009 by distributing materially false documents to investors in Ocala Funding that misrepresented the financial condition of the facility. The fraud scheme ultimately caused investors in Ocala Funding to lose more than $1.5 billion and Colonial Bank to lose $900 million.According to court documents and information presented at trial, TBW began running overdrafts in its master bank account at Colonial Bank because of TBWs inability to meet its operating expenses, which included payroll, servicing payments owed to third-party purchasers of loans and/or mortgage-backed securities and other obligations. In or about 2002, Farkas and other co-conspirators engaged in a series of fraudulent actions to cover up the overdrafts, first by sweeping overnight money from one TBW account with excess funds into another, and later through the fictitious sales of mortgage loans to Colonial Bank, a fraud scheme the conspirators dubbed Plan B. The conspirators accomplished Plan B by selling Colonial Bank mortgage loans that did not exist or that TBW had already committed or sold to other third-party investors. As Plan B evolved, co-conspirators at TBW also caused TBW to engage in sham sales of groups of mortgage loans, known as pools, that other entities already owned to Colonial Bank. As a result, false information was entered on Colonial Banks books and records, giving the appearance that the bank owned interests in legitimate pools of mortgage loans, when in fact the pools had no value and could not be securitized or sold. Neither Allen nor Ragland participated in the effort to cover up TBWs overdrafts or Plan B.Additionally, the co-conspirators at TBW caused TBW to misappropriate more than $1.5 billion in collateral from Ocala Funding. According to court documents, both Allen and Ragland played significant roles in the Ocala Funding misappropriation. The misappropriation caused Colonial Bank and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to falsely believe that they each had an undivided ownership interest in thousands of the same loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars.According to court documents, the fraud scheme also included an effort by certain conspirators in the fall of 2008 to obtain $570 million in taxpayer funding through the Capital Purchase Program, a sub-program of the U.S. Treasury Departments TARP. In connection with the application, Colonial BancGroup submitted financial data and filings that included materially false information related to mortgage loan and securities assets held by Colonial Bank as a result of the fraudulent activity at TBW. Colonial BancGroup never received the TARP funding. According to court documents, Allen played a key role in causing materially false information to be submitted to and received by the government in connection with Colonial Banks TARP application. Ragland was not aware of this aspect of the fraud scheme.In August 2009, the Alabama State Banking Department, Colonial Banks regulator, seized the bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver. Colonial BancGroup also filed for bankruptcy in August 2009.Instead of upholding his position of power and trust as CEO of TBW, Paul Allen chose the path of fraud and deception in helping facilitate the long-running fraud carried out by TBW and Colonial Bank. Fortunately, the scheme came to a halt when an attempt was made to steal more than a half billion dollars from the TARP, said Acting Special Inspector General for the TARP Romero. Todays sentence appropriately recognizes the severity of Allens participation in the fraud along with his cooperation in the Governments investigation.As a result of this complex fraud scheme, these defendants cost investors and our financial markets billions of dollars, said Assistant Director in Charge McJunkin. Todays sentence shows that those who take advantage of investors and our banking and mortgage systems will be held accountable. The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and remain vigilant in investigating these illegal transactions.Todays sentencing marks the culmination of a large effort on the part of this agency and of the law enforcement and regulatory community, said Deputy Inspector General Stephens of HUD-OIG. More importantly, however, it shows our nation that is slowly recovering from a damaged housing market that we are committed to bringing to justice those whose pernicious behavior contributed to this condition. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General is pleased to join our law enforcement colleagues in announcing this sentencing, said Inspector General Rymer of FDIC. We are particularly concerned in cases like this one where fraudulent activities involving employees of Colonial Bank in association with officials of Taylor, Bean and Whitaker contributed to the failure of Colonial Bank, resulting in a $3.8 billion loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund. We are committed to continuing our investigations of such criminal misconduct to help ensure the integrity of the financial services industry and maintain the safety and soundness of the nations financial institutions and the viability of the fund.Paul Allen used his extensive experience gained from employment with the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to assist Lee Farkas in his massive fraud scheme, said Inspector General Linick of FHFA-OIG. This sentence sends a strong message to individuals who would try to defraud Freddie Mac and American taxpayers, who have invested over $163 billion in the GSEs to date.The case is being prosecuted by Deputy Chief Patrick Stokes and Trial Attorney Robert Zink of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Charles Connolly and Paul Nathanson of the Eastern District of Virginia. This case was investigated by SIGTARP, FBIs Washington Field Office, FDIC-OIG, HUD-OIG, FHFA-OIG and the IRS-CI. The department recognizes the substantial assistance of the SEC. The department also recognizes the assistance of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the Department of the Treasury.This prosecution was brought in coordination with President Barack Obamas Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. President Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.

The protest focused on Ugg boots, which are made from sheepskin and are popular among college-age women.In addition to Uggs, which are openly noted as derived from animals, fur marked as fake may not actually be, PAWS vice president Alex Barnard 09 explained, adding that clothing imported from China is often unregulated, and recent studies indicate that cat and dog fur may be mislabeled as faux fur.PAWS hopes to address these issues and change peoples perceptions of fashion through the protest.We want people to realize that fur, whether it is fake or real, is just ugly, and theres no reason to wear it at all, PAWS president Jenny Palmer 09 said.Princeton is an ideal place for the protest because of furs association with social status, Barnard said. There is a lot of wealth here, he explained. There are people who wear animal products here because they can afford them.While PAWS members see demonstrations such as last Fridays as pivotal to awakening activism on campus, some students see the protests as unnecessarily graphic.Aly Lopez-Aguiar 09 noted that while she agrees with PAWS mission to decrease the use of fur in fashion, the use of fake blood was excessive, she said. If somebody sees something that graphic, theyre going to be turned off of the issue itself, she explained.Palmer, however, defended the use of provocative images.Theres always a risk [of offending people], she said. Sometimes theres a lot of apathy; we need to have these shocking images to force people to recognize that the clothes they choose to wear have an impact on animals lives.Public protests reach a wider audience than the speakers, educational programs and other events that PAWS sponsors, Palmer explained. Protests like the one at Frist aim to alert the public to see the controversy over fur as a wider issue, she said.While such demonstrations are perfectly within PAWS right to free speech, the graphic nature of the protest might give a negative impression to prospective students and people trying to get a sense of the University, Haley Thompson 11 said.There are a lot of people [who saw the demonstration] who arent students here, and they might find it offensive, Thompson explained.For Thompson though, wearing Uggs remains a personal decision, much like being a vegetarian. You do the same thing when you sit down and eat a hamburger, Thompson noted. I dont feel like its all that different, and Im not a vegetarian.Seeing the demonstration did not change her mind, she added. Im still going to wear my Uggs.There should be limits, however, to personal choice, Palmer said. We appreciate the right of people to make their own choices up to the point where it affects others, she said.Because animals may be crammed into cruel slaughterhouses and gassed, decapitated or electrocuted, however, individuals must be especially conscious of the implications of their clothing decisions, Palmer said.People dont have the right to cause that kind of pain, even if they choose to, she explained.Barnard said he hopes, however, that the event caused people to reflect on their fashion choices. If just a few people are affected by it, its a success, he said. Just a few people can make a difference.Barnard also said that the event took over a month to plan and was delayed by concerns that students might misinterpret the bloody scene as a reference to Virginia Tech and similar incidents.Last year, PAWS and PETA joined forces in front of Frist to protest killing the killing of animals for food. The demonstration featured students representing packaged human meat in an effort to advocate vegetarianism.",PAWS takes aim at Ugg boots,2/25/08,Rachel Dunn,right,context,right,,302,

The 400-mile-long Central Valley supplies fully one-quarter of the food America eats. It's a long, mostly flat and incredibly fertile pocket of land nestled between the coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada range.There are no marquee destinations, only sober, business-first cities and vast stretches of farmland and cattle range. But the Central Valley is beginning to change rapidly.Families looking for lower-cost housing in California's inflated housing market are trading a three-hour commute to work for a little country space and serenity -- and once-fertile fields are being paved over to make way for subdivisions. Farmers are under increasing pressure to reduce their dependence on chemicals for higher crop yields. And amid all this change, there is a huge Latino population -- many of them illegal immigrants -- whose lack of economic mobility impedes their assimilation into the American melting pot.In a series of four reports, NPR's Richard Gonzales and John McChesney profile the promise and pitfalls waiting for the Central Valley as more and more people and businesses discover the ""other California:""Part One: The Central Valley's Identity CrisisCalifornia's Central Valley is growing fast and its biggest industry, agriculture, racked up $27 billion in revenues last year. Yet the Central Valley is often referred to as the ""other California"" or California's ""backyard,"" and the valley's inhabitants are acutely aware that they do not share in the glamour of Hollywood or Silicon Valley. As the population of the valley's cities grows and agriculture's power shrinks, the region's identity crisis has become more acute. Many in the agricultural community have a defensive posture toward the coastal cities -- even while the valley's new urban centers are pushing for a share in the cultural and economic success of the coast. NPR's Richard Gonzales reports.View a photo gallery for Part One.Part Two: The Problem with PesticidesCalifornia's Central Valley is the most dynamic agricultural region in the world, yet farmers there are under tremendous pressure from new valley residents relocated from the coast and environmentalists to clean up their act. For decades, farmers have been exempted from clean air and clean water standards that apply to other industries. But now, the state says it is going to bring them into compliance. It's the water standards that have the farmers most worried -- farmers spray on the valley floor a third of all the pesticides sold in the nation. If they have to cut back, farmers warn that prices of tomatoes, pistachios and the 300 other crops grown in the valley will be more expensive. NPR's John McChesney reports.View a photo gallery for Part Two.Part Three: Central Valley, Going Organic?Some farmers in California's Central Valley say they have seen the writing on the wall, and have started efforts to grow without a huge dependence on chemicals. State officials are demanding that farms, exempted for decades, begin to comply with clean air and clean water standards. The birthplace of modern agribusiness, the Central Valley supplies a quarter of the nations' foodstuffs and sets trends for farming nationwide. So when big farms like Muir Glenn tomatoes ""go organic,"" it not only cuts down California water pollution, but it also provides a testbed for the viability of large-scale organic farming. But as NPR's John McChesney reports, going organic is not that easy.View a photo gallery for Part Three.Part Four: Farm Labor and Illegal ImmigrationIn 1949, historian and journalist Carey McWilliams wrote, ""The farm labor problem is the cancer which lies beneath the beauty, richness, and fertility"" of the Central Valley. More than 50 years later, McWilliams would probably come to the same conclusion. By the most conservative estimates, 50 percent of the valley's farm laborers are illegal immigrants -- other estimates run as high as 90 percent. Despite farm labor laws, workers are still subject to sub-minimum wages and dangerous working conditions. Whole towns are virtual labor camps aptly described as ""California's Appalachia."" The region is home to a multi-generational underclass of low-skilled, poorly educated workers and their families. But unlike immigrants of the past, these workers show no sign of being absorbed into an economic track that will improve their lives.View a photo gallery for Part Four.In DepthThe New California -- All Things Considered presents a four-part series on the changing demographics in California.

Like the Grinch who stole Christmas, scammers don't care if they ruin your holiday plans,"" said Carrie Hurt, president and CEO of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.Here are 10 scams to watch for:Gift Card ScamsGift cards are a favorite target for con artists this time of year, according to the BBB. And with retailers estimating gift-card shopping will hit an all-time high -- 80 percent of shoppers are expected to buy at least one this holiday season -- the BBB is warning consumers to be on the lookout for two sneaky schemes aimed at taking advantage of their popularity.Gift cards on display. ROBYN BECK / TodayIn one scheme, thieves go into a store, find the gift-card rack and then secretly copy the numbers off the cards, sometimes scratching off the security codes. The thieves then check online or call the 1-800 number to see if someone has bought the cards and activated them. As soon as a card is active, the thieves go on a shopping spree online. By the time you try to use the same card, the money is long gone.The BBB also warns consumers to be wary of offers for discounted gift cards sold online. Scammers may try to pocket your cash, and use the gift cards for themselves.Want an issue, a scam or a rip-off investigated? Email Rossen Reports.How to Protect YourselfBuy gift cards directly from a reputable retailer. And before you buy, inspect the card to make sure the packaging hasn't been tampered with and the activation code hasn't been scratched off. You can also ask a store clerk for a card that's been kept behind the counter. If you include a gift receipt with the card, it may help get a replacement.Package TheftWith more and more people shopping online this time of year, the BBB is warning people not to leave unattended packages on their doorsteps.From Seattle to San Diego to Houston, thieves have been caught on camera walking right up to houses and swiping packages right off the doorstep. Police believe the criminals follow delivery trucks into neighborhoods.How to Protect YourselfRequire a signature for the package and if no one's going to be home, have the package held at the nearest service location so you can pick it up at your convenience.Counterfeit Retailer WebsitesFederal authorities are warning many websites that appear to be selling popular brands could actually be fake. Officials say counterfeiters have stepped up their game in recent years, going beyond peddling phony merchandise on street corners and flea markets to form elaborate criminal networks to perpetrate their schemes.""What consumers need to be aware of is that as these networks have become more sophisticated, their ability to defraud consumers and legitimate businesses has increased significantly.,"" said Lev Kubiak, director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center.In the last year alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have shut down 1,500 fake retailer websites, including those appearing to sell high-end brand-name jewelry, popular clothing lines, workout DVDs and top kids' products.Many of the websites look nearly identical to real retailer web pages, with similar fonts, graphics, images, logos and layouts. ICE warns these fake sites often send inferior merchandise that falls apart or doesn't work, or may send nothing at all, instead stealing your personal information and credit card number.How to Protect YourselfOfficials urge consumers to do their research. Look for a working customer service number or a brick and mortar store and call them to ask if the site you're looking at is legit. They also say you should always use a credit card instead of a debit card when shopping online, it's easier to contest the charges. And finally, inspect the websites carefully. If you see grammatical errors or spelling mistakes, that could be a major red flag.Suspicious Social Media GiveawaysSecurity experts are also warning social media users of suspicious giveaway offers that may pop up on your Facebook and Twitter feeds. Researchers at the security software firm Trend Micro say they've found suspicious pages advertising raffles for two of the season's hottest gifts -- the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.Christopher Budd of Trend Micro says these ""giveaways"" and ""raffles"" appear to be using popular gaming consoles to lure people into unknowingly signing up for paid text message schemes.The offers solicit ""Likes"" or ""Shares"" to get distributed on social media feeds. Researchers say the more the offer is shared, the more likely people are to buy in.""It exploits what we in security call the circle of trust,"" said Budd.How to Protect YourselfBe wary of any giveaways or raffles that direct you to a survey site asking for personal information and your mobile phone number. Only sign up for promotions offered by reputable organizations.Six Other Scams to Watch For, According to the BBBRead the BBB's list here.Malware e-cards: E-mail greeting cards that appear to be from a friend or associate but actually contain a link that will download malicious software onto your computer to steal personal information.Grandparent scams: As families gather for the holidays, scammers will target the elderly with a desperate call or email from a ""stranded"" grandchild or loved one claiming they've had their wallets stolen and need money wired to them immediately.Mall pickpockets: Thieves take advantage of busy malls and frantic shoppers to steal purses and wallets.Bogus coupons: Coupons or discount codes are often sold online and in-person at a fraction of their face value. BBB warns they could be completely worthless.Santa scammers: If you get an email offering to send a personal letter from Santa to your child, be wary. It may be a phishing scheme aimed at collecting personal information for identity theft.Fake charities: Be on the lookout for ""sound alike"" charities and street-corner collectors. Do you research before giving.""The best way to avoid holiday scams is to educate yourself about what to look out for, and to be cautious in every situation,"" said Hurt.",'Tis the season for scams: 10 holiday rip-offs to avoid,,,context,context,n,,304,

He cited Paterno, whose reputation was tarnished by the lengthy child sex-abuse scandal involving his former assistant coach, on honor and dignity and respect. Paterno, the schools legendary coach, died just months after being fired days after the scandal became public in November 2011.Why dont you honor the job? Scaramucci told New Day anchor Chris Cuomo. Remember Joe Paterno? What would he say? Act like youve been there before.

Scaramucci is a minority owner of the New York Mets and was part of a group that purchased the jersey Mike Piazza wore in the first baseball game after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He may not be as consumed by football as his boss, who has railed about the NFL becoming soft just like our country has become soft, but he pays attention.

But will that be enough to quiet the storm over Mahers use of a racial slur during Fridays edition of Real Time with Bill Maher?Public outrage swelled following Fridays 10 p.m. live airing of Real Time with Bill Maher. HBO issued a statement Saturday calling the hosts use of the phrase Im a house n during an interview with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse completely inexcusable and tasteless. HBO said the remark would be edited out of subsequent airings of the episode. Maher made the comment in jest after Sasse invited Maher to spend a day working in the fields of Nebraskas farms.Maher acknowledged that the N-word was offensive and said he regretted using it. Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because Im up reflecting on the things I should or shouldnt have said on my live show. Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment, he said in a statement issued Saturday.By multiple accounts, HBO has no plans to take any action against Maher, who has been a mainstay at the network since 2003. A source noted that Maher has rarely offered any kind of mea culpa for provocative comments. Most recently, he stood firm in the face of harsh criticism for his decision to have the controversial blogger Milo Yiannopoulos, known for his racially charged online postings, as a guest on his show. The formal apology for using the N-word indicates that he recognizes that a line was crossed, something that was important to HBO.Related Bill Maher Apologizes for Using N-Word on HBOs Real Time HBO Calls Bill Mahers Use of N-Word Completely Inexcusable and TastelessBut the fury voiced on social media after Fridays airing stirred up examples of past statements from Maher about Muslims and the LGBTQ community that were widely deemed offensive. ThinkProgress, the editorial arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund, posted an article declaring Bill Maher has been a public racist for a long time with links to past clips from Real Time.The anger is an echo of the groundswell that led to the ouster in April of Bill OReilly, after the New York Times published an expose on sexual harassment allegations leveled at the Fox News host. It also has a parallel in Mahers past. Mahers ABC late-night show Politically Incorrect was axed after five years in June 2002 following Mahers observation that the U.S.s post-9/11 bombing campaigns against terrorist targets were cowardly acts. The comment sparked advertiser defections from the show  a pressure point that cant be used in the commercial-free environment of HBO.But at a moment of great political and cultural strife in the country, inflammatory statements and actions have been the undoing of numerous public figures. Just this past week, Kathy Griffin was forced to apologize amid a tidal wave of criticism from both the right and the left when she posed for a photo with a prop depicting President Trumps bloodied, severed head. Despite her apology, that stunt quickly cost Griffin her gig co-hosting CNNs New Years Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper.For Maher, another damaging video clip making the rounds on Saturday is an interview with comedian Wayne Brady from HuffPost Live in 2012, after Brady and Maher tangled over the latters assertion that Brady was a non-threatening black man. Brady said the comment indicates that Maher has a stereotypical view of black men as menacing.When I talk to you again, Ill give you that black dude and I will beat your ass in public, Brady said of Maher in 2012.Maher and Real Time have long been highly regarded in industry circles for the hosts willingness to confront thorny issues. The show earned consecutive Emmy noms for best talk-variety show from 2005 through 2014, and was nommed again in 2016.Reaction from viewers and industry insiders via social media to Mahers comment was, not surprisingly, fast and furious, and overwhelmingly negative. But Maher does have prominent supporters, such as author and Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson.Dyson condemned Mahers use of the N-word but defended his record of offering a platform to an array of African-American perspectives on politics and culture. Given the Bill Maher I know, he will use this opportunity to strengthen his role as an ally to black people, Dyson wrote.Spike Lee, meanwhile, had mixed feelings about the comedian.Oh, him using the n-word? I think its problematic. Ill leave it at that, he told Variety at a Brooklyn event on Saturday. I like Bill Maher, but I dont know if he should have used the n-word.Heres a sampling of more reactions:Please @HBO Do Not Air Another Episode Of Real Time With Bill Maher.

David Perdue advised attendees to offer up an ominous prayer aimed at President Obama during the 2016 Faith & Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority conference.,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/10/gop-senator-david-perdue-jokes-about-praying-for-obama-s-death.html,3,TRUE,No Error,"At a major event for conservative Christians this morning, a Republican senator joked about praying for President Obamas days to be short.Sen. David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia, opened his remarks at the Faith & Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority conference by encouraging attendees to pray for President Obama. But, he added in a joking tone, they need to pray for him in a very specific way: We should pray for him like Psalms 109:8 says: Let his days be few, and let another have his office, the senator said, smiling wryly.The crowd chuckled and he moved on with his address.The rest of that passage, which Perdue did not recite, reads, May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.The psalm is a pointed, lengthy death wish for one of Davids enemies.Let the creditor seize all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor. Let there be none to extend mercy to him, nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out, it continues.Perdues joke drew immediate criticism. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, tweeted, Republican Senator David Perdue is praying for President Obama to die. This is why Trump is the GOP nominee.As the Washington Posts Dave Weigel pointed out, conservatives have long invoked this verse in the yearning for an end to Obamas days in office. A Christian Science Monitor report from November 16, 2009, detailed the popularity of bumper stickers that read simply, Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8.Its protected speech, but its clearly offensive, the Anti-Defamation Leagues Deborah Lauter said at the time.The Road to Majority conference brings together top leaders in the social-conservative world, as well as prominent elected Republicans. Shortly after Perdues speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Trump adviser Sen. Jeff Sessions spoke. Donald Trump will keynote the event later today.UPDATE: After publication, Perdue spokeswoman Caroline Vanvick gave this statement to Bloombergs Sahil Kapur:Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that. However, we should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of.",GOP Senator David Perdue Jokes About Praying for Obamas Death,2006-10-16,Betsy Woodruff,right,right,n,,311,
